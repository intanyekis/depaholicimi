As a result, Benoist suffered from severe lacerations, a broken nose, and a torn iris.</p><p class=dh>At that time, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/blake-jenner-reflects-on-his-divorce-from-melissa-benoist/>Benoist covered up the abuse</a>, claiming on “Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon” that she had hit her eye on a plant. Benoist admitted that out of shame and fear, she hid the abuse she was suffering.</p><p class=dh>"Something inside of me broke, this was too far."</p><p class=dh>Since her 2017 divorce, Benoist has remarried to actor Chris Wood, and the couple welcomed their first child in 2020. Wood has been supportive of Benoist's determination to help other women who are going through the same horrific abuse experience.</p><p class=dh>Jenner has now reached out and apologized to his ex for the pain -- physical and emotional -- that he caused her. In his six-page post, Jenner spoke openly about the shame and the fear he felt after his secret was exposed.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Even though Jenner did apologize for throwing his iPhone at Benoist, he then went on to share out the guilt and the blame with his ex, whom he claims had also injured him seriously</strong></h3><p class=dh><strong class=bh>SHARING THE PAIN</strong></p><p class=dh>Jenner attributes the underlying rage and insecurity that led to his abuse of Benoist to a complicated childhood that led to "brokenness." It was jealousy, he claims, that led to his destructive outbursts.</p><p class=dh>Jenner then goes on to claim that he too suffered physical abuse at Benoist's hands and that his own career suffered from her jealousy and emotional outbursts. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CGGFpQgH8I5/>wrote</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I was made to pass on numerous jobs and opportunities because of jealousy of prospective female costars."</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>VICTIM BLAME</strong></p><p class=dh>Even though Jenner did apologize for throwing his iPhone at Benoist, he then went on to share out the guilt and the blame with his ex, whom he claims had also injured him seriously.

He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CGGFpQgH8I5/>wrote</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I also do believe(...) that accountability goes both ways and one has a right to defend oneself when deemed necessary."</p><p class=dh>Jenner ended his statement by apologizing to domestic violence victims for any pain his story might have brought back for them, and identifies himself first and foremost as a victim, who was violent in retaliation. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CGGFpQgH8I5/>wrote</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I stand with you as a victim myself, I repent for the abuse I inflicted as an aggressor myself."</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>A MARRIAGE MADE IN HELL</strong></p><p class=dh>Benoist revealed that the abuse had started on an emotional level even before the wedding and that five months into the marriage, had escalated to full-blown violence. In order to escape from an enraged Jenner, Benoist would lock herself in their room. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/tv/B5YUQ-JHck8/?utm_source=ig_embed">confessed</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I (...) quickly stopped because the door was inevitably broken down. I learned to not value any of my property (...) I learned not to value myself."</p><p class=dh>Benoist defined the violence as escalating from emotional to physical abuse and revealed that her own acceptance of the developing situation is something she cannot understand even now.</p><p class=dh>Every outburst would end in tearful apologies from Jenner, and Benoist would forgive him, excusing his violence by recalling the pain he had suffered in his past. Like so many victims of domestic violence, Benoist fell into depression and shielded her abuser with lies.</p><p class=dh>Jenner's partial and conditional apology is at odds with Benoist's testimony and could be construed as more of a justification of his own behavior. Due to the injury to her eye, Benoist's vision is permanently impaired.</p><p class=dh>She finally came out in public, in the hope that her own ordeal will help other women face their situation, and find the strength to leave, and start a new life.</p><p class=dh>Benoist has now been happily married to her "Supergirl" costar, Chris Wood since 2009, and her new life now includes a newborn son, Huxley Robert Wood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtqa25hZnquscuiqqyZXZeyr7vIrKusZZWterS8zq6qnmWSoa6ssYyjnKemlad7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-press-on-nail.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Best Press-On Nails for a Salon Quality Manicure</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jake-borelli-gay-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jake Borelli Almost Didn't Accept 'Grey's Anatomy' Role Because of Real-Life Insecurities</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-mariah-careys-worst-outfits-that-prove-she-has-no-fashion-taste.html>15 Of Mariah Carey's Worst Outfits That Prove She Has No Fashion Taste</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heres-how-much-the-cast-members-of-euphoria-make-per-episode.html>Here's How Much The Cast Members Of Euphoria Make Per Episode</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-bonet.html>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-belzer-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Richard Belzer obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX.
