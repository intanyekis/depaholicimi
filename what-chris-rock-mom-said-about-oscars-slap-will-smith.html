The infamous slap happened after comedian Chris Rock made a joke about <strong>Jada Pinkett Smith</strong>'s shaved hair during the ceremony, only to be then slapped by her irate husband<strong> Will Smith</strong>, who then proceeded to fire obscenities at Rock. The assault completely overshadowed the awards that evening, and after the clip of the incident went viral, it seemed that the slap was set to go down, as Chris himself joked, as <a href=#>one of the greatest nights in the history of television</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Will Smith Takes Trip—But Not To Chris Rock’s House To Apologize">Will Smith Takes Trip—But Not To Chris Rock’s House To Apologize</a></span></p><p>Though Smith later made a public apology and received a <a href=#>10-year ban</a> from the Oscars (<a href=#>despite keeping his Best Actor award</a>), many continue to be appalled by the assault - perhaps no-one less than Chris Rock's mother. Rosalie Rock, 77, gave an interview to NBC affiliate <a href=#>WIS of Columbia</a> recently, in which she damned Smith for his actions.</p><h2 id=rose-was-unimpressed-by-the-incident><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Rose Was Unimpressed By The Incident</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Opening up on the show,</a> Rosalie 'Rose' Rock explained her immediate reaction to seeing the slap.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Watching the event from home, Rock said that she initially assumed that the slap was staged and all part of the act. As Smith then began his tirade of expletive-ridden abuse, it dawned on her that this was quite real - her son Chris had been assaulted live on national television.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Chris Rock Has A History Of Making Fun Of Jada Pinkett Smith">Chris Rock Has A History Of Making Fun Of Jada Pinkett Smith</a></span></p><h2 id=she-had-this-to-say-about-it><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>She Had This To Say About It</span></h2><p>“You reacted to your wife giving you the side-eye and you went and made her day because she was mulled over laughing when it happened,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rock told host Billie Jean Shaw, speaking about Smith.</a></p><p>"When Will slapped Chris, he slapped all of us.
