But that doesn’t always mean the men she dates are wealthy, too.</p><p>The supermodel’s ex-boyfriend Tyler Cameron recently opened up about what his financial situation was like when they were dating in 2019, admitting he didn’t have much to his name. Tyler recently appeared on fellow Bachelor alum Jason Tartick’s podcast Trading Secrets where they subject was brought up.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kanye West To Release Documentary Exclusively Filmed On iPhone</a></span></p><p>"<a href=#>He goes to me, 'Dude,</a> I don't know what the f--- I'm doing. I got $5,000 in my bank account, I don't know what my next job is, and I'm dating Gigi Hadid!" Jason said in reference to Tyler’s short-lived romance with Gigi.</p><p>Tyler chimed in to say, "Not even $5,000 — I had like $200, you know what I mean?"</p><p>The reality star said the financial insecurity was caused by his “early days” of living in New York City, saying he was sleeping on Bachelor star Matt James’ beanbag as he had “no money.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tyler even admitted to asking for his family’s help to afford dates – possibly with Gigi.</p><p>"I'd be going on dates, I'm like calling pops up in the bathroom. I'm like, 'Pops, I don't think my credit card's gonna go through. I need you to send me some money right now.' And he's like, 'You got it, son, go get it," he continued.</p><p><a href=#>Tyler and Gigi were first linked in July 2019</a> when they were photographed spending time together. The pictures were published only days after Tyler was seen spending the night at his ex-girlfriend Hannah Brown’s house.</p><p>Hannah later admitted to being blindsided by his romance with the supermodel, but admitted she understood the appeal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“<a href=#>What’s crazy is, I loved Gigi Hadid!</a> I thought she was the coolest,” Hannah said in 2021. “I still do. I get it. I would even go on a date with her. I wanna be her friend! But never did I expect to be in a love triangle with her.”</p><p>Hannah echoed a similar sentiment to PEOPLE in 2021, admitting the situation was hurtful.</p><p>"I felt like I had to be strong and pretend it didn't bother me when it did," she said."I was deeply hurt. I said to Tyler, 'I'd date Gigi Hadid too if I could, I get it.' But it was not the way I wish it was handled."</p><p>Tyler and Gigi continued to date until October 2019, when she reportedly got back together with her long-time boyfriend, Zayn Malik. They announced her pregnancy the following winter.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kylie Jenner Lost Millions Of Followers & Dollars Amid Selena Gomez Feud</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Page Six</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9Oyo56qXZiurrHRqKVmq5GuwG60xGaumqtdl7%2Bwt8RmrqGdnmKxosDIp55mn5mctm60wJ2gnWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-hoda-kotb-not-on-today-show.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Is Hoda Kotb Not on Today Show This Week?
