For years it seemed like New Orleans native <a href=#>B.G.</a> might be one of these unfortunate cases, a sad story of what could have been, as <a class=underline-link href=#>he spent almost the entirety of the 2010s behind bars on felony weapons charges</a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space></span></p><p>After serving a long 11 years, <a class=underline-link href=#>B.G. was finally freed in September 2023</a>. While there might be a reasonable fear of being left behind by an ever-changing marketplace, the former <a href=#>Hot Boys</a> rapper seems to have adjusted effortlessly to his much-deserved position as an OG in the rap game, immediately hopping on the <a class=underline-link href=#>“Yonce Freestyle” with Kevin Gates and Sexyy Red</a> after his release. The collaborative <a class=underline-link href=#><i>Choppers & Bricks</i></a> alongside <a href=#>Gucci Mane</a> marks the king of Chopper City’s first official project since he teamed up with <a href=#>Boosie Badazz</a> on 2010’s <a href=# rel=noopener><i>225504</i></a>.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>B.G. might not have had timeless hits like <a href=#>Juvenile</a> or the mainstream crossover success of <a href=#>Lil Wayne</a> — although his diamond-encrusted debut single <a href=# rel=noopener>“Bling Bling”</a> did change the game by birthing a new jewelry-related pop culture term <a href=# rel=noopener>which was later added to dictionary</a> — but he was a lowkey lynchpin of the Hot Boys, eventually paving his own way as an independent spitter rather than remain under the stifling wing of <a href=#>Birdman</a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space></span></p><p>Years before Birdman’s legal and financial disputes with the likes of Wayne and <a href=#>Young Thug</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>B.G.’s messy split from his former collaborators</a> was one of the first signals that all was not right within the house of Cash Money. On some level, the success of bluesy Louisiana rappers like Gates and <a href=#>NBA YoungBoy</a> has ensured that there’s still room for B.G.’s distinctive Gulf Coast drawl.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>B.G. and Gucci might feel like they’re of different generations when it comes to their careers but they’re actually the same exact age. <i>Choppers & Bricks </i>is like a special crossover issue of a comic book, where two of your favorite superheroes unexpectedly join forces. There’s also a clear kinship between the pair in terms of <a class=underline-link href=#>their experiences of incarceration</a>; Gucci is in many ways an ideal mentor for B.G. at this moment in his career, a shining example of not just successfully transitioning back to civilian life, but ensuring his comeback is bigger than his setback.<span class=Apple-converted-space></span></p><p>Though Gucci actively continued releasing mixtapes while in prison, his career easily could have been derailed by his charges, but <a class=underline-link href=#>he returned bigger than ever as a bonafide pop star</a> — while it’s difficult to imagine B.G. ever hopping on a track with <a href=#>Bruno Mars</a>, Gucci is living proof that almost anything is possible when a hustler sets their mind to it.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Gucci’s voice might be more familiar in the 2020s, but B.G. frequently shows him up, like on “Guwop & Gizzle,” where B.G.’s flow is slick and nimble while Gucci’s feels more restrained in its tight syncopation. There’s a musicality to B.G.’s voice — he’s not usually outright singing, but the limber dexterity infuses an inherent melodiousness to the hooks on songs like “Idiots Worst Nightmare.” Where Gucci has a fairly consistent pace to his delivery, B.G. twists his tongue in unexpected directions, playfully toying with the beat. On “Run A Bag Up,” B.G. is firmly in pocket, breaking into a quick sprint of a delivery.</p><p>Though the beat is forceful and the flows are menacing, it’s unexpectedly emotional to hear <a href=#>C-Murder</a> on “Project Baby,” knowing that <a class=underline-link href=#>the No Limit legend is still behind bars fighting for his freedom</a>, after years of pleading that he was wrongfully convicted for <a class=underline-link href=#>the murder of a 16-year-old back in 2002</a>. But there’s something hopeful in the song’s existence as well — B.G. and Gucci might have regained their own freedom, but they aren’t forgetting about the ones still fighting for their lives, and it gestures toward a future where C-Murder might similarly return to reclaim his rightful crown.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/12/bg-teases-greatest-comeback-in-hip-hop-history-in-2024-250x142.jpeg alt="B.G.

But B.G. still sounds fresh over anything you throw his way, despite the years and the mileage he’s endured, and there’s also a newfound depth.<span class=Apple-converted-space></span></p><p>Over dusty boom bap drums on “Paperwork,” he reflects on the precarity of not just his career, but his entire life: “<i>Every time I look around, hood buryin’ a G/ Wonderin’ if the next week, they gon’ be buryin’ me/ Carryin’ me, on a fresh white tee wearin’ me</i>.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><i>Choppers & Bricks</i> might find B.G. fully back on his grind, but you can hear the weight of all the years he spent in a cell, as he grimly acknowledges the heat that perpetually exists around the corner for Black men in America.</p><p><strong>RELEASE DATE:</strong> December 15, 2023</p><p><strong>RECORD LABEL:</strong> 1017 Records/Atlantic Records</p><p><strong>Listen to Chopper & Bricks below:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51kv6bCyJ6urGeXqrCktYymmKedXZe0bq%2FHqKepnaKoeqO%2ByJyirGWRoa%2B2uYyrnK%2Bhlaw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./laura-smet-and-raphael-lancrey-javal.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Laura Smet and Raphal Lancrey-Javal</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fiona-palomo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bio, Parents, Net Worth, Relationship Status, And Age</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-mariah-careys-worst-outfits-that-prove-she-has-no-fashion-taste.html>15 Of Mariah Carey's Worst Outfits That Prove She Has No Fashion Taste</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heres-how-much-the-cast-members-of-euphoria-make-per-episode.html>Here's How Much The Cast Members Of Euphoria Make Per Episode</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-bonet.html>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-belzer-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Richard Belzer obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX.
