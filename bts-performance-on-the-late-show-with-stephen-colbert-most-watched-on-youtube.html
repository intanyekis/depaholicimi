It's happening gradually, going up really slow, so I think we could expect more for the future. It's happening, and I hope that it's not just a happy accident. We have to keep up with the work."</p><p>Given their success in the US, the group was asked how they planned on building momentum. Monster explained that keeping a cool head was the best way to go about it.</p><p>"To capitalize on this, we have to not lose our minds. That's how we capitalize on this. Because we don't want to be so happy for this that we release an English song. Those things are really great, but we have to keep up with what we're doing. Getting ready for our next album. And, of course, we'll be coming back to America, I think more often because we're getting positive attention."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Without a doubt, the group had the right mindset.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZratdpbKzss6rpJqmk5p6sLqMrZ%2BeZZyWwaZ50qGmsGWnnsGpedKtnKmglaN6pLvLm5yrrF2ivLTAjLCYrZuYmrFuu81msKitpKqvpns%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tori-brixx-dating-boyfriend-married-age-height-family-career-birthday-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tori Brixx's Dating, Boyfriend, Age, Bio, Wiki, Height, Career, and Networth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./steve-poapst.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Steve Poapst</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-mariah-careys-worst-outfits-that-prove-she-has-no-fashion-taste.html>15 Of Mariah Carey's Worst Outfits That Prove She Has No Fashion Taste</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heres-how-much-the-cast-members-of-euphoria-make-per-episode.html>Here's How Much The Cast Members Of Euphoria Make Per Episode</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-bonet.html>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-belzer-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Richard Belzer obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX.
