He rode the 'Smoney Dance' wave to release another hit, 'Hot Boy.'</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The song ended up No. 1 on the Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. As of this writing, the track boasts a whopping 778 million views and counting on YouTube.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The track that made platinum in less than 50 days put the young rapper on Epic Records' radar.</p><p>They reached out with a deal. How could they not? The once ultra-viral 'Shmoney Dance' went from Vine to Beyoncé and Rihanna's hips. Even Drake invited Shmurda on the stage during one of his concerts.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bobby Shmurda Taking One for&nbsp;Rowdy Rebel</h2><p>When he was charged, Shmudra pled not guilty on all counts at a hearing in Manhattan Supreme Court and was ordered to be held on a two million dollar bail. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In another hearing, his lawyers requested the bail to be lowered, but the judge refused as the prosecution&nbsp;characterized him as the "driving force" in GS9.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Shmurda was looking at 25 years in prison for the most serious of his conspiracy charges.</p><p>He was offered an 8-year plea deal, but he refused. Soon after, the rapper and his girlfriend were accused of having her smuggle him a knife into Rikers Island. However, both of them pled not guilty again.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After refusing the plea deal for so long, he finally agreed to it on September 9, 2016. He later explained to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Complex</a>&nbsp;why he did it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I did it for Rowdy [Rebel]. They offered me five [years]&nbsp;and offered Rowdy 12. They said the only way they’ll give him seven is if I took seven, too. So, you know, I had to take one for the dawgs.</p><p>He was sentenced to seven years, two of which he had already served.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>While his original sentence dictated that he be out by December 11, 2021, he was later given a conditional release in February 2021.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Bobby Shmurda Walks a Free Man</h2><p>Shmurda&nbsp;is not the first rap artist to land behind bars, and many others have jumpstarted their career the moment they were set free—the customary 'First Day Out' freestyle announcing their presence back in the scene.&nbsp;</p><p>Some like <a href=# rel=follow>Draco The Ruler</a> even recorded tracks over the phone while still inside.
