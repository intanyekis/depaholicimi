We can all agree that it won’t be too long before his personal wealth eclipses the billion dollar mark. There are so many ventures and industries he’s involved in: music&nbsp;and sports management, fashion, lifestyle, champagne, etc. And in case you forgot, he still makes music and earns a boatload of money on tours too. With the re-launching of his new TIDAL music streaming venture, he’s really going against the big boys who are already embedded deeply in this field – names like Spotify, Pandora and even Beats by Dre’s streaming service. The thing with <a title="Jay Z Net Worth" href=#>Jay-Z</a> is that he’s never scared to take on the giants. Digital is definitely the next frontier and Jay-Z wants a big piece of that pie. To show everyone that he truly means business, he has curated some of the biggest and most influential names in the music biz as co-owners in his new music streaming venture. Here they are below:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-kanye-west><strong>15. Kanye West</strong></h2><p><a title="Kanye West Net Worth" href=#>Kanye</a> is another budding global mogul in his own right. He might not quite be at Jay-Z's status yet, but he’s well on his way. These days, it seems Kanye has been focusing more on the music and is readying his new album So Help Me God to be released this year. Also his new mega-collaboration with Adidas just launched and that looks like it will be a huge hit too. His co-ownership of TIDAL with his mentor and Watch The Throne bandmate, Jay-Z is a great way for him to diversify into the always lucrative tech sector. Kanye gets a little too obsessed about fashion sometimes. This could be a much needed distraction.</p><p></p><h2 id=14-j-cole><strong>14. J.Cole</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the young age of 30, <a title="J. Cole Net Worth" href=#>J.Cole </a>, who is signed to Jay-Z’s Roc Nation management agency has firmly arrived as one of the elite rappers of the new generation. His last album 2014 Forest Hills Drive released late last year just went platinum and he’s currently touring in support of the LP. To date, Cole hasn’t really shown much of an entrepreneurial attitude except for the launching of his own music label, Dreamville Records. However being a co-owner of TIDAL along with his mentor Jay-Z is a perfect way for him to take his money and wealth to the next level.</p><p></p><h2 id=13-rihanna><strong>13. Rihanna</strong></h2><p>No doubt about it, the influence of the sexy Bajan beauty known as <a title="Rihanna Net Worth" href=#>Rihanna</a> on the music, fashion and lifestyle industry is very heavy indeed. She has been on the cover of Vogue and other respected fashion magazines umpteen times, and fashion brands literally beg for her to wear one of their outfits. She’s also gearing to release her new album R8 and has already dropped two trending singles “Four Five Seconds” and “Bitch Better Have My Money.” This new venture with TIDAL is a little bit of a different look for her, but with her kind of brand-boosting power, she is most likely to come out on top.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=12-alicia-keys><strong>12. Alicia Keys</strong></h2><p><a title="Alicia Keys Net Worth" href=#>Alicia Keys</a> is one of the most successful soul and R&B singers of our time. She is a supremely talented singer, songwriter and instrumentalist and it’s no wonder that her net worth is listed as a very robust $50 million. Most recently, she hasn’t been putting out new music; she’s the mother to two young kids with her husband <a title="Swizz Beatz Net Worth" href=#>Swizz Beatz</a> and she also recently popped up in an elegant new perfume ad for Givenchy. One thing she really excels with is her global charity efforts and her being part of this TIDAL venture really brings a warm humanitarian side to the project.</p><p></p><h2 id=11-madonna><strong>11. Madonna</strong></h2><p>Is there a pop singer alive with more staying power, longevity and live performance experience than the one and only<a title="Madonna Net Worth" href=#> Madonna</a>? And the most impressive thing is that at the age of 56, she seems to have no plans of slowing down at all. This past March, she released her 13th studio album Rebel Heart that shot to the top of charts as usual. Interesting tidbit: Madonna has also been saying that she’s a huge fan of Toronto rapper <a title="Drake Net Worth" href=#>Drake</a>. There might actually be a collab coming soon. Jay-Z convincing her to be one of the TIDAL co-owners is a huge score indeed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=10-daft-punk><strong>10. Daft Punk</strong></h2><p>No matter where you were in 2013, you couldn’t escape the catchy, chart-topping single “Get Lucky” from French electronic duo, Daft Punk. That single was helmed by none other than <a title="Pharrell Williams Net Worth" href=#>Mr. Pharrell Williams</a> and funk legend, Nile Rogers. The song went on to win the impressive “Album of the Year” award at the 2014 Grammy’s and it was certainly a fitting win. Fans everywhere are waiting for the next release from these reclusive geniuses. For having an anchor in the electronic music world, Jay-Z couldn’t have picked a better group.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-deadmau5><strong>9. Deadmau5</strong></h2><p>The EDM scene is a massive money-earner in the music industry. We have artists like <a title="Deadmau5 Net Worth" href=#>Deadmau5</a>, <a title="Skrillex Net Worth" href=#>Skrillex</a>, <a title="Afrojack Net Worth" href=#>Afrojack</a>, <a title="Avicii Net Worth" href=#>Avicii</a> and more touring the world and making heaps of cash. In the case of Deadmau5, he’s an extremely established artist and this year he will be headlining the Bonaroo Music and Arts festival in the United States. That’s a really big deal indeed for an EDM artist. With him as part of the TIDAL team, Jay-Z has a really strong foothold in the world of electronic dance music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-arcade-fire><strong>8. Arcade Fire</strong></h2><p>Montreal has produced some really special acts, but one of the most popular has to be the eclectic and extremely unorthodox alt-rock outfit, Arcade Fire. They constantly sell out stadiums and festivals all over the world, and they have even appeared on the Hunger Games soundtrack and performed on Saturday Night Live. The leader of the group is Win Butler and seems to be&nbsp;a really cool dude. He also has a DJ career on the side where he plays gigs under the name DJ Windows 98. They are definitely one of the more unique acts on the TIDAL co-owner list.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-jason-aldean><strong>7. Jason Aldean</strong></h2><p>When you talk about the big names in country music right now, you of course have to mention <a title="Blake Shelton Net Worth" href=#>Blake Shelton</a>, <a title="Carrie Underwood Net Worth" href=#>Carrie Underwood</a>, <a title="Miranda Lambert Net Worth" href=#>Miranda Lambert</a> and the next owner on our list, <a title="Jason Aldean Net Worth" href=#>Jason Aldean</a>. Aldean has been on the scene since 2005, and during that time, he’s had numerous hits and a couple of platinum albums. There was no way Jay-Z could assemble a wide array of owners in the music field and leave out a genre as lucrative as country. Say what you want, but Jay-Z is one smart fellow!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-jack-white><strong>6. Jack White</strong></h2><p>Similar to Kanye West, Detroit rocker <a title="Jack White Net Worth" href=#>Jack White</a> is one of the most unpredictable and outspoken characters in music today. His talent is undeniable. As a leader of groups like The White Stripes and The Dead Weather, he has put out some absolutely incredible music. The addition of Jack White is a great way for Jay-Z to have a firm footing in the rock world. Jack White has even had some Kanye-esque rants at some of his shows last year, so it seems that he will fit into this new crew just fine.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-nicki-minaj><strong>5. Nicki Minaj</strong></h2><p>It’s probably fair to say that <a title="Nicki Minaj Net Worth" href=#>Nicki Minaj</a> has now taken the official throne as the current queen of hip-hop. Her last LP, The Pink Print was a certified smash featuring mega-hits like “Anaconda” and “Truffle Butter” featuring Drake and <a title="Lil Wayne Net Worth" href=#>Lil Wayne</a>. The LP was always warmly embraced because it featured songs that appealed to both her pop/mainstream fans and her more hardcore street audience. Jay-Z made a wise choice for including perhaps the most influential female in hip-hop right now to be part of the TIDAL fold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-usher><strong>4. Usher</strong></h2><p>At the age of 36, <a title="Usher Net Worth" href=#>Usher Raymond</a> is one of those names and faces that everybody knows in the music industry. His career trajectory could be almost compared to that of a child actor, because he started in the music industry when he was only in his young teens. But he has managed to stay relevant through the times and even star on hit television shows like The Voice. If there’s one person who has probably seen it all in the music industry, it’s Usher and he can provide some key insight to Jay-Z and the new TIDAL venture.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-chris-martin><strong>3. Chris Martin</strong></h2><p>With <a title="Chris Martin Net Worth" href=#>Chris Martin</a>, the leader of the band Coldplay, it’s definitely all about the music. You never see him talking on a record about how much money he has, how much expensive art he buys or how many diamond watches he owns. Chris and his separated wife <a title="Gwyneth Paltrow Net Worth" href=#>Gwyneth</a> have long been friends with&nbsp;Jay-Z and <a title="Beyonce Net Worth" href=#>Beyonce</a>, so we can totally see how him being part of this new music streaming venture was a total no-brainer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-calvin-harris><strong>2. Calvin Harris</strong></h2><p>At the young age of 31, the handsome DJ, songwriter and producer <a title="Calvin Harris Net Worth" href=#>Calvin Harris</a> is worth a very respectable $46 million (according to Forbes). Why&nbsp;so much cash you ask? Well, put simply, this man makes huge hits. He has also makes a ton of money from the DJ gigs he does all over the world. He was dating Rita Ora in the past, but most recently he’s been linked to America’s own sweetheart, <a title="Taylor Swift Net Worth" href=#>Taylor Swift</a>. Whichever way you cut it, this guy is a major force in the music industry right now, and him being part of Jay-Z’s Tidal music streaming venture is a really big deal.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-beyonce><strong>1. Beyonce</strong></h2><p>When the net worths of Jay-Z and his superstar wife Beyonce are combined, the total amount is well over a billion dollars. Now, that’s the real definition of a power couple. With the amount of influence, selling power and sheer popularity that Beyonce wields, it makes perfect sense that Jay-Z decided to include Queen Bey in this new TIDAL venture. Don’t look now, but it seems this couple is about to get even richer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources:<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>nytimes.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>hollywoodreporter.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>nola.coml</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>fashionnstyle.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>spin.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqbV2brq671KxknKddpMSvsdGsZKieXZ%2BuunnZrGStoZSWuW6%2F06ucmqWZo7Ruv8SrraKblWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jake-bongiovi-teases-big-year-for-millie-bobby-brown-on-her-birthday.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jake Bongiovi Teases Big Year for Millie Bobby Brown on Her Birthday</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-truth-about-kaitlin-armstrong-nose-job-rumor.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Truth About Kaitlin Armstrong Nose Job Rumor!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-mariah-careys-worst-outfits-that-prove-she-has-no-fashion-taste.html>15 Of Mariah Carey's Worst Outfits That Prove She Has No Fashion Taste</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heres-how-much-the-cast-members-of-euphoria-make-per-episode.html>Here's How Much The Cast Members Of Euphoria Make Per Episode</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-bonet.html>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-belzer-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Richard Belzer obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX.
