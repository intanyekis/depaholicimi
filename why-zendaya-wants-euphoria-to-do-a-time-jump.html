"It’s funny. I was actually supposed to direct episode 6, but then I had to act in it," she shared. "I didn't have enough time, so unfortunately, I wasn't able to this time around. I wanted to have enough time to do it the right way."

"I think it’ll be exciting to explore the characters out of high school. I want to see what Rue looks like in her sobriety journey, how chaotic that might look," she said in August 2022.</p><p>"But also with all the characters, in the sense where they're trying to figure out what to do with their lives when high school is over and what kind of people they want to be. What was special about this season was that we got to dive into [the other characters] in a much deeper sense. I think we can do that again with the third season.
