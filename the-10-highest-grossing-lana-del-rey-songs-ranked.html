The album peaked at No. 1 in 11 countries and sold an estimated 3.4 million copies in 2012. She instantly emerged from a niche artist to a mainstream star.

The record sold an estimated 16,700 vinyl copies in seven days.</p><h2 id=summertime-sadness>Summertime Sadness</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guardian</a>, the biggest hit single of Del Rey has a painful past. The EDM, which looks like a found home footage video, is inspired by a friend’s suicide. One of her dearest friends committed suicide in the summer, as depicted in the music video by Kyle Newman. The song was part of the debut <i>Born to Die</i> album, released in 2012. It became a massive sleeper hit in 2013 when <a href=#>French house producer Cedric Gervais</a> turned the sad song into a dance floor anthem. The song peaked at number four on the <i>Official Singles Chart</i>, clocking 95.5 million streams and an estimated 1.53 million chart sales.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's How Lana Del Rey Earns & Spends Her Millions</a></span></p><h2 id=young-and-beautiful>Young And Beautiful</h2><p>The most haunting melody from the star-studded soundtrack of the <i>Great Gatsby</i> (2013) movie is written by Lana and the iconic songwriter Rick Nowels.

According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Uproxx</a>, the haunting dark undertone song is inspired by the infamous suicide of actress Peg Entwistle, who danced on top of the famed H of the Hollywood sign In LA and then plunged to her gory death fifty feet below. The same has been depicted in Del Rey’s music video, which garnered approximately 22 million streams. The album was nominated for the Grammy Awards for Best Vocal Pop Album.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=high-by-the-beach>High By The Beach</h2><p>The hit single sold over 248,000 digital copies in the first week and peaked at number seven on the <i>Billboard Top 100</i> chart.

The music video pays homage to the 50s golden age of Hollywood with vintage cars and classic references. The song peaked at number 32 on the <i>Official Singles</i> chart and sold an estimated 402,000 units in sales.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=love>Love</h2><p>Originally titled <i>Young and In Love </i>is the opening track from Lana’s fifth studio album, <i>Lust for Life</i>.
