Euphoria star <a href=#><strong>Sydney Sweeney</strong></a> and her co-star Glen Powell in their 2023 holiday movie Anyone But You had to make it the case.</p><p>Their chemistry elevated the typical screenplay to a romantic comedy worth watching, and <a href=#>Sweeney and Powell could not stop flirting with each other during the press tour</a>. The movie ended up being a box office hit, making over $219 million during its run in the theaters. The success led to rumors of a sequel in the works, but Sydney Sweeney's big break on the silver screen is partly due to her chemistry with Glen Powell.</p><p>Sydney Sweeney had a big break with Anyone But You, proving she can lead a cast in a film. However, her "fake" relationship with Glen Powell sold the movie more than the script, and they leaned heavily into the ship. Furthermore, she is slowly getting more projects, with back-to-back calls from Sony Pictures (specifically). She is, undoubtedly, one of the rising talents of her generation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-and-glen-powell-rsquo-s-quot-fake-quot-relationship-gave-them-their-big-break>Sydney Sweeney And Glen Powell’s "Fake" Relationship Gave Them Their Big Break</h2><h3 id=sweeney-and-powell-fueled-fan-speculation-by-leaning-on-their-rumored-fake-relationship>Sweeney and Powell fueled fan speculation by leaning on their rumored fake relationship</h3><p>Anyone But You was different from all Sydney Sweeney movies and TV shows because she had a lot to prove.

Sydney is very smart," Powell told The New York Times.</p><p>"The two things that you have to sell a rom-com are fun and chemistry. Sydney and I have a ton of fun together, and we have a ton of effortless chemistry."</p><p>Understanding fan demands and giving exactly what they wanted turned out to be the catalyst that set off Sweeney and Powell's big break.

Even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeney's role in Madame Web was also a smart career move</a> — despite the movie being a box office bomb.</p><p>Her role in Hollywood is written to make a difference, with some calling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sydney Sweeney a divisive star of her generation</a>, despite of the criticism she has received.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With her handling the wheels of her own production company, the actress has more options in playing unique characters. Immaculate, her second film as a producer projects Sweeney's options and hopes. And with more movies like Barbarella, The Registration, and a biopic about legendary boxer Christy Martin in the works, Sweeney is expanding her repertoire to include more versatile characters.</p><p>No wonder she is being compared with the likes of Margot Robbie and Ana de Armas, who did not want to fit in the bombshell mold Hollywood had fixed them in.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqspyemsZuv9aenKedqWKzorfEZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWWXobKvec%2Borp6knGKvqrOMm6memZtk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./heather-locklear.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is American Actress Heather Locklear?
