Tori, 49, shared the adorable slideshow of moments from her trip to the pumpkin patch with her kids on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> on Oct. 24, which included her daughters, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Stella</strong></a>, 14, and <strong>Hattie</strong>, 11, and sons <strong>Finn</strong>, 10, and <strong>Beau</strong>, 5. Missing from the shot was Tori’s eldest child, 15-year-old <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Liam</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The cover shot showed the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Beverly Hills, 90210</a> alum proudly posing with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the kids she shares with Dean</a> surrounded by large orange pumpkins. That was followed by several shots of Beau smiling with some pumpkins and even an adorable video of him sliding down a giant blow-up slide. Tori also shared selfies of her with each of her sons, as well as a solo shot of her sitting on hay with pumpkins at her feet and one in her lap. “Pumpkin … Patch vibes…” she captioned the post.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Dean was noticeably absent from the photo, which a few fans expressed their concerns about in the comment section. This isn’t the first time the actor has been absent from family photos, however. Amid rumors that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tori and Dean are trying to save their marriage</a> after <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>years of turbulence</a>, Dean <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>did not appear in the family’s 2021 Christmas pictures</a>. However, in January, an insider <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>revealed to HollywoodLife</strong>&nbsp;EXCLUSIVELY</a> that the spouses of 17 years are “working things out for the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;sake of their kids</a>” and that they “realized that they have too much to lose by getting a divorce and that their lives together are much better than they would be apart.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Meanwhile, Dean, 55, took to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> on Oct. 25 to share an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>image</a> of him posing with Mary Jo, 60. The pair both donned black ensembles and stood in front of a dark gray wall. In the photo Dean shared, he smiled with his arms crossed over his chest, while Mary leaned on his left shoulder with her right hand. “Reunited??? #Ex’s&Uh-oh’s,” he captioned the post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tori-spelling-takes-kids-to-pumpkin-patch-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Mary shared a similar <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>image</a>, but instead of resting her hand on Dean’s shoulder, she rested her entire head on it. “Reunited?” she wrote in the caption with a red heart emoji. “@imdeanmcdermott @torispelling #Ex’s&Uh-Ohs!” The fact that Mary tagged Tori in the caption led to fans theorizing in the comment section that the threesome is working on a reality show together. Furthermore, a friend of Mary’s named <strong>Maria McKee</strong> commented under her post and wrote, “Can’t wait to tune in babe!” However, such a show has not yet been announced and nothing about a reality show in progress has been listed on their respective IMDb pages.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Tori has not yet shared such a photo or promoted anything with a name similar to “Ex’s & Uh-Oh’s”, but a collaboration between the three would not be out of the question considering Tori and Mary are quite friendly. Dean and Mary revealed on Dean’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daddy Issues with Dean McDermott, Adam Hunter and Nicky Paris</a> podcast in 2019 that Mary and Tori became close after they all celebrated Mary and Dean’s son’s birthday. “Our son <strong>Jack</strong> turned 21, so he came into town from San Francisco with some of his friends, and we went and had a lovely dinner,” Dean recalled on the podcast. “Tori and Mary Jo were communicating about the party, and then the texts started to get friendly.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>He later added,&nbsp;“Through all this, it started this dialogue, and the dialogue got friendlier and friendlier. Cut to Friday night at the restaurant, Tori sits down, Mary Jo is to her left, I am to the right of Tori. Tori turns her back on me the whole night, turns into Mary Jo, and that is when the lovefest began.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FuZq2nop56tLzEpaOippdiuKqw0manrqWgoLavec%2Baq5ygXay2tbTOrqtmnJWWu265wp2cq6WfqcFuvMeoq6irXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tyler-hamilton-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tyler Hamilton Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-swift-allegations-plagiarized.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Swift Responds To Allegations She Plagiarized One Of Her Biggest Hits</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-mariah-careys-worst-outfits-that-prove-she-has-no-fashion-taste.html>15 Of Mariah Carey's Worst Outfits That Prove She Has No Fashion Taste</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heres-how-much-the-cast-members-of-euphoria-make-per-episode.html>Here's How Much The Cast Members Of Euphoria Make Per Episode</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-bonet.html>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-belzer-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Richard Belzer obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX.
