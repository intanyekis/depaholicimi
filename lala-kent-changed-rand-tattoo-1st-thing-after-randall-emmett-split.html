I gotta get this thing off my arm.’”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“I’m the type of person where when I’m done, my wall goes up,” she said to Stylish, referencing <a href=#>her split with Emmett</a>, 50. “I have no feeling.

The phrase not only made its way onto a <a href=#>pink hoodie</a> in her merch shop, but it also became the catchphrase for her “Give Them Lala” tour, which she will be doing solo.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s1>“I’ve got a brand new format for the tour & its everything I’ve ever dreamed of.

The emblem doesn’t just relate to her podcast podcast, it’s found on her best-selling book, <a href=#>makeup brand and skincare line</a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p3><span class=s1>That said, she’s not making any moves until she gets her mom’s stamp of approval. “I’ve gotta have my mom be ok with it,” she joked to Us. “I think she’s looking at me being like, ‘How did we go from no tattoos to tattoos everywhere?’”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p3><span class=s1>Kent also has a tattoo of her dog’s name, “thug life,” “heathen,” an orca design, a heart around her nipple, “GIVE THEM LALA” in white ink and a lion design.
