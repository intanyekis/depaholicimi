Kim Kardashian made the announcement on July 6th via Twitter. She explained that KKW Beauty plans to expand its products. While it first started out with a contour kit, the company has expanded to carry eye, lip, and body products over the years.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Brown Facing Pricey Lawsuit After His Dog Allegedly Attacks Housekeeper</a></span></p><p>But that’s not all. Kim added that the entire brand will be getting an overhaul, including its packaging and ingredients. She said KKW Beauty wants to move towards&nbsp; clean, sustainable ingredients as well as eco-friendly packaging. A second tweet added that the company will also be focused on improving their customer shopping experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“We can come back to you under a completely new brand with new formulas that are more modern, innovative, and packaged in an elevated and sustainable new look,” Kim explained in her post.</p><p>Insiders told TMZ that the rebranding wasn’t motivated by poor sales or performance. Rather, KKW Beauty continues to thrive and is one of the most popular American makeup brands. Instead, the move was likely driven by Kim’s new partnership with Coty Inc., which recently paid a cool $200 million to become a partner in KKW Beauty.</p><p>In January, it was reported that Kim had sold 20% of the company for $200 million to Coty Inc., a multinational beauty company that was originally founded in 1904 by Francois Coty. The company owns more than 77 beauty brands across the world, with Kim’s KKW Beauty being one of its most recent (and famous) acquisitions. Their other well-known brands include CoverGirl, MaxFactor, and Clairol.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rumor has it that Coty Inc. is also helping Kim create a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">skincare brand</a> that is scheduled to launch in 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Complex</a> reports. They also reportedly have plans to help the reality star break into nail, haircare, and personal care products.</p><p>KKW Beauty isn’t the only Kardashian-owned makeup brand getting an overhaul. According to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">press release on Coty’s website</a>, the company is also helping <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner’s</a> brand <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Cosmetics</a> re-launch with new formulas that promise to be clean and vegan. Coty Inc. added that Kylie Cosmetics products will be refreshed in new packaging. The revamped brand will be available in certain retailers as well as through a new direct-to-consumer website as of July 15th, which will offer access to both Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skincare.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kylie originally launched her makeup collection in 2015 with her infamous Lip Kits. She sold most of the company to Coty Inc. in 2019 in a landmark $600 million deal.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton Marry In Lavish July 4th Weekend Wedding Ceremony</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Coty</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Complex</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4qrmMpJirnJGotaqtzaxkpKOnYq%2BmrdStsGaqlZe%2ForrDoqWgZZOkwbp7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lainey-wilson-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lainey Wilson Bio (Wiki)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./keke-palmer-dating-boyfriend-dating-history-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Keke Palmer, Dating, Boyfriend, Past Affairs, Sexuality</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-mariah-careys-worst-outfits-that-prove-she-has-no-fashion-taste.html>15 Of Mariah Carey's Worst Outfits That Prove She Has No Fashion Taste</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heres-how-much-the-cast-members-of-euphoria-make-per-episode.html>Here's How Much The Cast Members Of Euphoria Make Per Episode</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-bonet.html>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-belzer-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Richard Belzer obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX.
