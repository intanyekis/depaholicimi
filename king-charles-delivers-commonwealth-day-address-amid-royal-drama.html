I have no doubt that we will continue to support one another across the Commonwealth as, together, we continue this vital journey.”</p><p>The royal family kicked off 2024 with news that Charles was set to <a href=#>undergo surgery</a> for an enlarged prostate. Buckingham Palace confirmed in February that Charles had officially been diagnosed with an <a href=#>unspecified form of cancer</a>. Royal reporter <strong>Omid Scobie</strong> later confirmed via <a href=# rel=noopener>X</a> that Charles’s diagnosis was no prostate cancer. In the wake of his diagnosis, royals such as <strong>Queen Camilla</strong> and <strong>Princess Anne</strong> stepped in to take over Charles’ royal duties and public appearances.</p><p>“It is equally heartening to hear how sharing my own diagnosis has helped promote public understanding and shine a light on the work of all those organizations which support cancer patients and their families across the U.K. and wider world,” Charles wrote in <a href=#>a statement</a> released via Buckingham Palace last month. “My lifelong admiration for their tireless care and dedication is all the greater as a result of my own personal experience.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/King-Charles-III-Deeply-Touched-by-Good-Wishes-Amid-Cancer-Battle-in-Commonwealth-Day-Address-2.jpg><p>While making his first public appearance since his diagnosis with U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak last month, Charles admitted that the public’s well-wishes have “reduced me to tears most of the time.”</p><p>Charles officially <a href=#>returned to royal duties</a> earlier this month by meeting with Britain’s Chancellor of the Exchequer <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> at Buckingham Palace. Two days later, <a href=#>he hosted</a> the high commissioner of Jamaica, <strong>Alexander Williams,</strong> and his wife, <strong>Carol Watson-Williams</strong>, during a meeting at the palace on March 7.</p><p>While Charles is back to work, <strong>Princess Kate Middleton</strong> has been out of commission since <a href=#>undergoing abdominal surgery</a> earlier this year. The pair’s health scares have caused concern for the status of the royal family, especially since only four major royals are under the age of 70.</p><p>“It is clearly a challenge for the monarchy, no question about that,” <strong>Robert Hardman</strong>, author of The Making of a King: King Charles III and the Modern Monarchy, exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in January. “It is a much smaller working unit than it used to be.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/King-Charles-III-Deeply-Touched-by-Good-Wishes-Amid-Cancer-Battle-in-Commonwealth-Day-Address-3.jpg><p>Despite the palace stating from the beginning that Kate was set to be MIA from royal events <a href=#>until Easter</a> as she recovered, speculation about her whereabouts have run rampant on social media. The princess spoke out for the first time on Sunday, March 10, <a href=#>sharing a family photo</a> with the <a href=# rel=noopener>caption</a>: “Thank you for your kind wishes and continued support over the last two months. Wishing everyone a Happy Mother’s Day.”</p><p>After the AP <a href=#>pulled the photo</a> because of suspicions that it was altered, Kate released <a href=#>a new statement</a>. “Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing,” she explained via <a href=# rel=noopener>social media</a>. “I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused. I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother’s Day.”</p><p>Hours later, she was <a href=#>spotted leaving the palace</a> with <strong>Prince William</strong> to go to a private appointment. The couple were photographed in a car leaving Windsor Palace on Monday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoZ6ceqS0wKujnqtdmbKttdWeqaxlk6S6rrvNsJyapKSdeqWt2GaYnZyimsC0ecCmoJ1loqTGoriMnamapZFk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./larsa-pippen-net-worth-offered-money-by-dubai-boyfriend-dating-michael-jordan-son-marcus.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Larsa Pippen Could Have Been Much Richer Had She Not Dated Michael Jordan's Son</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./richest-soccer-player-athletes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jimmy Greaves Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-mariah-careys-worst-outfits-that-prove-she-has-no-fashion-taste.html>15 Of Mariah Carey's Worst Outfits That Prove She Has No Fashion Taste</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heres-how-much-the-cast-members-of-euphoria-make-per-episode.html>Here's How Much The Cast Members Of Euphoria Make Per Episode</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-bonet.html>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-belzer-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Richard Belzer obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX.
