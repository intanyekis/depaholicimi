It consists of 32 professional teams that are equally divided between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). The NFL is the highest professional level of American football in the world. Their 17-week regular season runs from the week after Labor Day to the week after Christmas, and each team plays 16 games and has one bye week. After the end of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, and there's a single-elimination game that results in the Super Bowl, which usually takes place on the first Sunday in February, and is played between the NFC and AFC champions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1920, the NFL was formed as the American Professional Football Association (APFA) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season. The NFL merged with the American Football League (AFL) in 1966, and the first Super Bowl was held at the end of that season. The merger was completed in 1970. Today, the NFL has the highest average attendance (67,591) of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports league in the United States. The Super Bowl is one of the biggest sporting events in the world, and Super Bowl games account for the majority of the most watched television programs in American history. That being said, the NFL is a sport that's loved by men and women alike.</p><p>Here are 15 of the most distracting female NFL fans. In a good way, of course.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katy-perry><strong>Katy Perry</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Katy Perry</a> may have only become a New York Giants fan after their Super Bowl XLVI victory over the New England Patriots, but that doesn't mean she isn't trying. In fact, she's making up for years of her absent support by wearing enough Giants gear that it looks like the franchise has exploded on her.</p><p>The Giants celebrated their 21-17 win over the Patriots in many different ways, even with Perry. And there was tight end Travis Beckum&nbsp;who had torn a knee ligament the night. But he grinned when asked about the rumblings a blue-haired Perry arriving at the party looking for him. "I love her," he said three times, still on crutches but obviously feeling a lot less pain. "We exchanged, uh, pager numbers. I'm probably going to page her later. She was hoping for a speedy recovery. And I was saying I just love her." We don't blame him for feeling that way. There's no doubt that Perry is a gorgeous woman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=meagan-good><strong>Meagan Good</strong></h2><p>Yes indeed, <a href=#>Meagan Good</a> is very, very good for New York Jets fans. She's possibly one of the hottest wives and girlfriends (WAGs) ever. In 2007, she began dating former running back Thomas Jones&nbsp;right around the time he was dealt from the Chicago Bears to the Jets. Good was such a huge Jets fan that she tattooed Jones' name on her finger. Unfortunately, relationships with professional athletes don't last as long as tattoos, and the couple parted ways in 2010.</p><p>In 2011, Good began dating <a href=#>DeVon Franklin</a>, an executive for Columbia Pictures and a Seventh-day Adventist preacher. They became engaged in April of 2012 and married at Triunfo Creek Winery in Malibu, California on June 16, 2012. They have stated that they remained virgins prior to their marriage. They live together in Los Angeles, California. Even though Good isn't dating an athlete anymore, she's still a good-looking Jets fan that turns heads.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-garner><strong>Jennifer Garner</strong></h2><p>The San Francisco 49ers' fanbase is in the midst of an image crisis, but you might spot <a href=#>Jennifer Garner</a> at Levi's Stadium this season. Garner has her husband, <a href=#>Ben Affleck</a>, to thank for her love of baseball and the Boston Red Sox, but she obviously isn't a sports fan just for brownie points. Garner has impressed <a href=#>Jay Leno</a> fans by reciting the Red Sox's lineup on live television.</p><p>At least Garner doesn't side with Affleck's New England roots in each sport. She's actually a 49ers fan. She reportedly has cheered for the Red and Gold since she was a child. The 49ers may have a bright future with new general manager <a href=#>John Lynch</a> and head coach Kyle Shanahan, but we shall see. For now, let's keep an eye on Garner, who looks beautiful with (or without) makeup. She's attractive for a 45-year-old and likely is hoping for her team to have a decent season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stacy-keibler><strong>Stacy Keibler</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Stacy Keibler</a> started to cheer for the Baltimore Ravens when she was 18. We don't mean just root for them. The Rosedale, Maryland native was an actual cheerleader for the Purple and Gold before appearing in the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) ring and dating notorious ladies' man <a href=#>George Clooney</a> from 2011 to 2013.</p><p>Despite straying away from Maryland, Keiber remains dedicated to her home team, which is a good thing. In 2000, she won $10,000 in a contest to become a member of the World Championship Wrestling's Nitro Girls and used the prize money to buy season tickets for the Baltimore Ravens. In 2004, Keibler moved to Los Angeles, California where she was a roommate with her friend, <a href=#>Torrie Wilson</a>. In 2013, Keibler began dating Future Ads CEO Jared Pobre. The couple got married in Mexico on March 8, 2014. Their daughter, Ava Grace Pobre, was born on August 20, 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=marisa-miller><strong>Marisa Miller</strong></h2><p>We have to note another beautiful 49ers fan. This time, it's <a href=#>Marisa Miller</a>, a Santa Cruz, California native who is best known for her appearances on the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issues from 2002 to 2008. She has also worked for Victoria's Secret. Miller's accomplishments have led to her being dubbed as the "return of the great American supermodel."</p><p>Off the runway, Miller is the real deal. She has remained a 49ers fan, despite tons of mediocre seasons in the NFL, and deserves props for staying true to her home team. In an interview with Around the NFL writer, Dan Hanzus, she said, "I'm from Santa Cruz in Northern California and the 49ers were my dad and I's bonding time...We would go to games in the '80s. It was a good time to fall in love with football when your team was unstoppable." She added, "My biggest memory as a football fan was the Super Bowl in '89 against the Cincinnati Bengals," she said. "We were at this restaurant in Santa Cruz called The Crow's Nest. I think I was 10 or 11 years old and I remember just everybody going nuts. It was the first time I saw adults act like children. It was such a huge moment. <a href=#>John Taylor</a>'s catch, that was one of the best memories ever."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=demi-lovato><strong>Demi Lovato</strong></h2><p>It's not that hard to figure out why <a href=#>Demi Lovato</a> became a Dallas Cowboys fan in the first place. Lovato was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico and raised in Dallas, Texas. Her mother, Dianna De La Garza (nee Dianna Lee Smith), was a Cowboys cheerleader. Her mother wasn't the only one performing for America's team, though. She sang the national anthem for the Cowboys' Thanksgiving game in 2008 and another game against the Seattle Seahawks in 2011.</p><p>Even though Lovato lives in southern California now, she remains a Texas girl at heart. She has talked about her unlikely love for metal music. Her passion for the Cowboys contributes to the Texan persona. As you can see in this photo, she's showing her support for rookie quarterback, Dak Prescott, who proudly wears the No. 4 for the Cowboys. Prescott's rookie year may be a fluke, but we shall see. Anything can happen in football.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kendra-wilkinson><strong>Kendra Wilkinson</strong></h2><p>When you hear about the San Diego Chargers, <a href=#>Kendra Wilkinson</a> is likely the first female fan that comes to mind. She was born in San Diego, California and raised in Claremont, California where she played softball with the Claremont Bobby Sox for six years and attended Claremont High School. She then worked as a glamour model and an administrative assistant in a dentist's office before finding success at the Playboy Mansion in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, California.</p><p>Wilkinson's mother was a cheerleader for the Philadelphia Eagles. Maybe that played a role in her relationship with former Eagles wide receiver <a href=#>Hank Baskett</a>. The couple got married on June 27, 2009. More recently, she tweeted, "Goodbye San Diego Chargers. Goodbye. I have faith you will find yourself home again but I still won't turn my back on you. ? #ChargersToLA" In a relocation ordeal, it's clear she's still sticking to her home team.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=faith-hill><strong>Faith Hill</strong></h2><p>It's pretty hard not to be an NFL enthusiast when you're married to <a href=#>Tim McGraw</a>, whose football viewing isn't limited to Sunday afternoons. The country singer and Tennessee Titans fan has confessed to <a href=#>Rich Eisen</a> of the NFL Network that he brings the family to high school football games on Friday nights and settles in to watch LSU on Saturday afternoons.</p><p>Like her hubby, Hill has also been a Titans fan her whole life. She once told USA Today, "Dinner has to be planned out around the game, homework has to be finished. It's an all-gather-around the television time." The Titans aren't particularly good and not particularly bad. They're not the splashiest team either. Their signing of Marcus Mariota is one of the worst contracts in franchise history. Mariota is an outstanding quarterback and the Titans are&nbsp;lucky to have him. He has the accuracy, athleticism, leadership ability, and versatility. In general, not too shabby for a rebuilding team.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elizabeth-banks><strong>Elizabeth Banks</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Elizabeth Banks</a> has never dated an athlete. In fact, she met her future husband, Max Handelman, on her first day of college at the University of Pennsylvania on September 6, 1992. The couple got married on an unspecified date in 2003. Through a surrogate, they had their first child, a son named Felix, in 2011. They also had a second son, Magnus Mitchell, by surrogate in 2012.</p><p>It's perfectly understandable why Banks religiously cheers on the New England Patriots and Boston Red Sox. The actress grew up on Brown Street in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. In 2015, she watched the Patriots triumph over the Seattle Seahawks, 28-24, at the University of Phoenix Stadium. She also got to watch the Patriots bounce back in a come-from-behind win to defeat the Atlanta Falcons, 34-28, in Super Bowl LI. Like other Massachusetts natives, she certainly gave her home team a lot of support when they need it the most.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=erin-heatherton><strong>Erin Heatherton</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Erin Heatherton</a> walked away from the Victoria's Secret runway for a reason. Following her decision, Heatherton took to Instagram to reveal her struggles with body image and how she was able to grow into the confident, beautiful woman that she is today despite feeling like a failure early in her career. Heatherton then revealed that she was told to lose weight and that she tried to eat healthy and exercise twice daily, but it never seemed to be enough.</p><p>The Chicago Bears were unable to pull off a win against the New York Giants on November 20, 2016, but that didn't stop Heatherton from proving that you can support your favorite team and look great at the same time. At the event, she rocked a Bears long-sleeved t-shirt with a leather jacket layered beneath a black shaggy coat and enjoyed a pre-game, sideline rivalry with Briana Thevenin, sister to New York Giants player <a href=#>Victor Cruz</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lopez><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></h2><p>Apparently, the Miami Dolphins will sell a stake to anybody because their celebrity owners range from <a href=#>Fergie</a> to <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a> and her ex-husband, <a href=#>Marc Anthony</a>. The Latin superstar couple split up in 2014, but they didn't let that get in the way of their business interests. Not only do they still share their portion of the Dolphins, but they continue to work together on the Univision reality show ¡Q’Viva!: The Chosen.</p><p>Entertainers dabbling in the ownership of sports teams is nothing new as the NBA has had its fair share of part owners such as <a href=#>Jay-Z</a>, <a href=#>Nelly</a>, and <a href=#>Usher</a>. But when it comes to the Dolphins, their owner, <a href=#>Stephen M. Ross</a>, simply wants more publicity to gain more fans in the South Florida community. J-Lo would've looked awfully great in green and white, but she looks just fine donning Dolphins' colors. Anthony told the New York Daily News, "For the past couple of years I have expressed interest in some kind of team...I couldn't be more excited. (But) I still have to talk to my father-in-law, who is a huge Jets fan."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=carrie-underwood><strong>Carrie Underwood</strong></h2><p>American Idol alum <a href=#>Carrie Underwood</a> was born and raised in Oklahoma, and like many football-loving people in the areas in and around Texas, she's a Dallas Cowboys fan and possibly the team's most glamorous (and talented) supporter.</p><p>Shortly after winning Idol's fourth season in 2006, Underwood performed at her first halftime show at Texas Stadium on Thanksgiving. The following year, she made headlines by dating Cowboys quarterback <a href=#>Tony Romo</a>&nbsp;and despite their split, still remains a die-hard Cowboys fan today. She even sings the opening theme song for Sunday Night Football on NBC. We may not agree with her NFL team, but her home state doesn't have a team, so she wound up picking a team that's a few hundred miles away. There's no doubt she's beautiful, so it doesn't matter who she roots for and what players she likes because she'll look good regardless. Heck, she can even pass as a Cowboys cheerleader!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=maria-menounos><strong>Maria Menounos</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Maria Menounos</a> is a big-time New England Patriots fan. Born and raised in Massachusetts, the TV host of Greek descent definitely has love for her home team. The Patriots are, without a doubt, the best team in the NFL today, and only a couple of other teams can match up to its recent history.</p><p>Menounos watched Super Bowl LI at NRG Stadium on February 5, 2017 when her excitement overtook her. As <a href=#>Tom Brady</a>'s team staged the craziest comeback in Super Bowl history, the E! News host had the ultimate freak-out that resulted in her losing a small diamond from her engagement ring. The moment was caught on tape, so E! News was able to reveal Menounos' passionate fandom that cost her part of her beloved ring. Following the incident, Menounos told E! News, "It pays to be a superfan of the Patriots...I didn't know that I could break my ring being a superfan but apparently that's what happened."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ciara><strong>Ciara</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Ciara</a> gave Seattle Seahawks quarterback <a href=#>Russell Wilson</a> a sporting try after a messy relationship with rapper <a href=#>Future</a>, with whom she had a son with in 2014. She began dating Wilson in 2015, became engaged to him in March of 2016, and got married at the Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England on July 6, 2016. They have a daughter, who was born in April of 2017. Although this is Ciara's second child, she's not letting it get in the way of rooting for the team her husband plays for.</p><p>Ciara considers herself a member of the Seahawks' 12th man. The tradition, the stadium, and most importantly, the crowd noise are everything that makes the 12th man so special. However, the two-time Super Bowl appearing franchise has regressed significantly in 2015, and Seahawks fans have blamed Ciara, claiming she cursed Wilson and the team's fortunes. The calls for the ouster of Ciara went to cartoonish levels as some fans wanted the songstress to be banned from the city limits of Seattle. Just let the pretty WAG cheer for her man and leave her alone!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessica-alba><strong>Jessica Alba</strong></h2><p>If there were a competition for the hottest sports fan, <a href=#>Jessica Alba</a> would definitely get our vote. Oakland Raiders fans are known around the world as the rowdiest, most extreme, passionate, and devoted fans in all of sports. Have you ever heard a sports anchor refer to Red Sox Nation or [insert team name here] Nation? Well, they got that idea from the Raiders.</p><p>Alba was born in Pomona, California to a racially diverse family. Her father's Air Force career took the family to Biloxi, Mississippi and Del Rio, Texas before returning to Claremont, California when she was nine years old. She may be from southern California, but she apparently stays close to the Bay Area. After all, she was often seen sitting courtside, throwing up the W at Golden State Warriors games. When it comes to football, she has been spotted rocking Raiders gear, which is perfectly fine because she looks good in the Silver and Black.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2ivLTAjJ2grKyilrC1tc2gZJ%2BdnZa5pnnNn6NmnpGjwG61zWaYZp%2BfpLFuw8CyZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./16-modern-wwe-wrestlers-who-would-have-been-perfect-for-dx.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>16 Modern WWE Wrestlers Who Would Have Been Perfect For DX</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./antron-pippen.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Unsolved Death Mystery About Scottie Pippen's Eldest Son</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-mariah-careys-worst-outfits-that-prove-she-has-no-fashion-taste.html>15 Of Mariah Carey's Worst Outfits That Prove She Has No Fashion Taste</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heres-how-much-the-cast-members-of-euphoria-make-per-episode.html>Here's How Much The Cast Members Of Euphoria Make Per Episode</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-bonet.html>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-belzer-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Richard Belzer obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX.
