They have another parent. I have to leave and sometimes I don’t want them photographed and they don’t come with me. This whole year I’ve been very surprised by how archaic some of the mindsets still are in some people.”</p><p>The Transformers star went on to bash the “mean, awful people and cruel people” online who have shamed her eldest child’s style over the years.</p><p>“I don’t want him to ever have to read that s–t because he hears it from little kids at his own school who are like, ‘Boys don’t wear dresses,’” Fox told the magazine.</p><p>In September 2019, the model first opened up about <a href=#>Noah’s reaction to school bullies</a>.</p><p>“He had stopped wearing dresses for a while,” the New Girl alum said on The Talk at the time. “He just wore one two days ago to school. He came home and I was like, ‘How was it? Did any of the friends at school have anything to say?’ And he was like, ‘Well, all the boys laughed when I came in, but I don’t care. I love dresses too much.’ … I send him to a really liberal, hippie, school, but even there, here in California, he still has little boys going, ‘Boys don’t wear dresses,’ or, ‘Boys don’t wear pink.’ So we’re going through that now.”</p><p>The Jennifer’s Body star added that she was working to teach Noah “to be confident no matter what anyone else says.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The little one loves to “design and draw outfits,” she went on to tell the hosts. “He’s very talented, but he’s still 6 so … I did [a fitting] recently and I had this really beautiful yellow dress on. He kept draping it in a way where he was like, ‘If we do it like this, it looks like a diaper.’ Like, ‘That’s not what we’re going for this time, but maybe next time.’”</p><p>Green, 47, has<a href=#> previously spoken about Noah wearing dresses</a>, telling Hollywood Pipeline that the 8-year-old isn’t “harming anyone” and “should be having fun.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Beverly Hills, 90210</a> alum, who split from Fox in late 2019, concluded, “If he wants to wear a dress, awesome!
