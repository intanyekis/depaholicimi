Michaels released her first single in 2017. Her song “Issues” was a huge success, which was followed up by her first EP Nervous System. Michaels has released many EPs, and her first full length album Not In Chronological Order was released in 2021. JP Saxe also released his first single “Changed” in 2017. Since then, he has released a lot of music including his album Dangerous Levels of Introspection in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Michaels and Saxe first met in a songwriting session. They wrote and recorded the Grammy-nominated hit “If The World Was Ending” in 2019. The two singers bonded over music and got along great, and soon they were a musician power couple. Sadly, the couple recently announced that they are no longer together. Let’s get into why Julia Michaels and JP Saxe called it quits.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>9 Singers Who Turned Down Grammy-Nominated Songs</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-julia-michaels><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Who Is Julia Michaels?</span></h2><p>Julia Michaels is a singer and songwriter. She began her career in the music industry by writing for others, but when she wrote “Issues” she knew no one else could sing it but her. Michaels released the song in 2017 and has found great success with her music ever since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2021, Michaels released her first full length album. Not In Chronological Order revealed a new side of Michaels and her skills. “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I’m talking about love</a> and I’m talking about growth in love, and I’m talking about how good it feels to be in something that doesn’t feel toxic,” she said of the album.</p><h2 id=who-is-jp-saxe><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Who Is JP Saxe?</span></h2><p>Like Julia Michaels, JP Saxe is also a singer and songwriter. Their journeys in the music industry are very similar as they both previously worked behind the scenes before taking center stage in 2017. That year, Saxe released his first single “Changed.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His debut album came in 2021 with Dangerous Levels of Introspection. The album was very well received. It included his 2019 hit with Michaels “If the World Was Ending” and many others of his hits. Saxe has also released a stripped down version of the album.</p><h2 id=julia-michaels-slid-into-jp-saxe-rsquo-s-dms><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Julia Michaels Slid Into JP Saxe’s DMs</span></h2><p>Music lovers will never forget the hit 2019 song “If the World Was Ending” by JP Saxe and Julia Michaels. They wrote this song during their first songwriting session together, which was also the first time they met. Michaels has since revealed how the songwriting session came to be.</p><p><a href=#>As many other celebrities have in the past</a>, Michaels slid into Saxe’s DMs. She thought he was incredibly talented and wanted to work with him. Little did she know the two would start dating only nine days later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>A Timeline Of Julia Michaels And Niall Horan’s Friendship</a></span></p><h2 id=when-did-julia-michaels-and-jp-saxe-start-dating><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>When Did Julia Michaels And JP Saxe Start Dating?</span></h2><p>JP Saxe does not claim to be a very bold person, but he certainly was when it came to dating Julia Michaels. After their first songwriting session together, Saxe told Michaels to invite him out for drinks. He wanted to see her again and took her to a date in the park.</p><p>The two have been dating ever since writing “If the World Was Ending.” “I am obsessed with her as much as the day I met her, honestly, more,” JP Saxe told Ryan Seacrest, <a href=#>the extremely successful television and radio personality</a>. Fans of the couple love hearing Saxe and Michaels talk about each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michaels-rsquo-s-ldquo-all-your-exes-rdquo-about-jp-saxe><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Michaels’s “All Your Exes” About JP Saxe</span></h2><p>As they are both talented songwriters, it is not surprising that Julia Michaels and JP Saxe bonded over music, nor is it surprising that they continued to write music together. On Michael’s album Not In Chronological Order, her and Saxe wrote two songs together, “All Your Exes” and “Little Did I Know.”</p><p>“All Your Exes” is actually about JP Saxe. Michaels is known for digging deep into her personal life for her inspiration, and this song was no different. Saxe was even featured in her music video for the song, which is <a href=#>popular among musical couples</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jp-saxe-moved-in-with-julia-michaels-during-pandemic><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>JP Saxe Moved In With Julia Michaels During Pandemic</span></h2><p>JP Saxe and Julia Michaels were very serious about their relationship. They chose to move in together, the choice especially driven by the global pandemic. The two singers did not want to risk not being able to see each other. Saxe and Michaels moved in together after about two years of dating.</p><p>“<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We live together now</a>. We are about to have our two-year anniversary,” Saxe revealed to Sunday World. “I think she is absolutely brilliant, and there is nothing more encouraging to me in my life than having her respect.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Famous Singers Were Homeless Before Their Big Break</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=julia-michaels-and-jp-saxe-hint-breakup-in-songs><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Julia Michaels And JP Saxe Hint Breakup In Songs</span></h2><p>The rumors on social media and Julia Michaels and JP Saxe’s split were started due to the couple themselves. The two singers shared clips on social media of upcoming music, and the lyrics had fans questioning the status of their relationship.</p><p>Saxe shared lyrics from “When You Think Of Me” on September 9th, which were “I swear I loved you fully and I’m sorry not for staying who we thought I’d be.” The following day, Michaels shared her own upcoming lyrics, which seem to be a response to Saxe. She sang “You’re just another man and this is just another doorway […] You keep saying that you’re staying when we both know that’s not your forte.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jp-saxe-and-julia-michaels-split><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>JP Saxe And Julia Michaels Split</span></h2><p>Sadly, the rumors seem to be true.
