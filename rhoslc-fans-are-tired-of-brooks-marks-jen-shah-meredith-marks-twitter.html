While fans are eager for the series to focus on <a href=#>Jen Shah's legal woes</a>, it seems as if there is one storyline that they have had enough of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Last season, <a href=#>Jen Shah and Meredith Marks</a> found themselves at a standstill when Shah repeatedly liked and commented unfavorable things about Meredith's son, Brooks Marks. Although it seemed to have stopped following the season one reunion, Jen is up to her old tricks again, and Meredith has had it!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything We Know About 'RHOSLC' Newbie, Jennie Nguyen</a></span></p><p>Well, the issues involving Jen and Brooks seem to be getting dragged out this time around, and while it's evident that Jen has crossed many lines, not just with Meredith and Brooks, it seems as if viewers are over their nonsense, especially considering Brooks is not a cast member.</p><h2 id=jen-shah-vs-brooks-marks>Jen Shah vs. Brooks Marks</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the very first season of RHOSLC, fans were introduced to jewelry designer, Meredith Marks and her 21-year-old son, Brooks. While their family dynamic was certainly enjoyable to watch, it appears as if fans are tired of seeing Brooks on their screens, mainly when it comes to his feud involving cast member, Jen Shah.</p><p>Jen, who has been called out for liking, retweeting, and commenting on homophobic, insensitive, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">negative tweets regarding Brooks</a> and his sexuality, is getting a taste of her own medicine this time around. After being confronted by Meredith during tonight's episode, Jen revealed that she was not the one behind the actions taken on her social media accounts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is no surprise, considering Jen Shah has proven to be incapable of taking any accountability or responsibility for her wrongful actions. Jen shared that she has someone else run her social media accounts, which is the same excuse she used to defend herself from Heather's accusations regarding her being called "Shrek" and a "manatee". Yikes!</p><p>Brooks, who is practically the eighth cast member on RHOSLC, is livid over Jen's continued behavior, and Meredith Marks is obviously sticking up for her son. Although fans can see the wrong that Jen has caused, it's becoming tiresome to keep up with, especially considering it involves a non-cast member; Brooks.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why 'RHOSLC' Fans Want Jen Shah Fired</a></span></p><h2 id=fans-are-tired-of-the-storyline>Fans Are Tired Of The Storyline</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As season two continues, the Brooks vs. Jen storyline has now been dragged out for three episodes, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">viewers are getting tired of it!</a> Many fans have taken to social media to express their disdain over the storyline, and have even added in why Brooks returned for a second season if his first had caused so much pain to him and his family.</p><p>"I'm sorry if Meredeth doesn't want Brooks talked about STOP filming with him and having him in every single scene you're in," one fan wrote on Twitter. Considering Brooks is, in fact, in most scenes that Meredith is, it's clear that scoring air time might be more important than scoring some peace of mind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brooks revealed last season that he had taken time off from school to be with his mother back in Salt Lake, as Meredith and her hubby, Seth, were experiencing marital issues at the time. Well, it seems as if his gap year has since extended to a second, however, fans are certain he's taking advantage of the show, which has done wonders for his tracksuit collection.</p><p>Despite Meredith and Jen attempting to resolve things at the ice fishing outing, Meredith disengaged yet again, meaning their friendship is still very much on the fritz. With no reconciliation happening between the two, it's no shock that the storyline will continue to get dragged out in future episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Brooks is not a cast member!!!! He needs to learn that. Stop inserting yourself in drama and expecting nobody to respond," one viewer tweeted out. While this is what makes reality television so good, viewers have a point! If the show is bringing far too much negative energy to Brooks, then perhaps it's best if he doesn't appear on the show, especially taking into account he doesn't even hold a snowflake.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How 'RHOSLC' Star Mary Cosby Really Earned Her Millions</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipoaejobBussCnqmaZopp6tbXRnptmp5Zir7O7zqSqZqWRp7i0ecmepWarmJa1brnEq5ydoaSdeq6t0aSqZqynnsG1sdFo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./actor-scott-evans-arrested-124158.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Actor Scott Evans Arrested</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./prince-harry-jokes-about-losing-his-hair-im-doomed.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Prince Harry Jokes About Losing His Hair: 'I'm Doomed'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-mariah-careys-worst-outfits-that-prove-she-has-no-fashion-taste.html>15 Of Mariah Carey's Worst Outfits That Prove She Has No Fashion Taste</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heres-how-much-the-cast-members-of-euphoria-make-per-episode.html>Here's How Much The Cast Members Of Euphoria Make Per Episode</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-bonet.html>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-belzer-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Richard Belzer obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX.
