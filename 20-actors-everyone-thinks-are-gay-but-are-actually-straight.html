Many people share her views on that issue, while many others respect but do not agree with her views. What we can all agree on for a fact is that acting is not easy and, just like any other profession out there, it has its challenges that an actor needs to overcome. Anyone who can read a script, get into character and bring the character that is on paper to life, is a great actor deserving the praise that comes with his or her accomplishments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These days, many movies and series have gay characters in them, but you find that most of the people playing these roles are straight. A&nbsp;fan who has closely followed a particular actor for a period would be shocked to see him or her playing a role that has been inconsistent with what he or she is known for. Apart from the very experienced actors like <a href=#>Johnny Depp</a> who can execute any role flawlessly, most other characters tend to lack a certain convincing aspect when they are too far from their comfort zone.</p><p>Therefore, when we, the audience, are introduced to an actor playing a character who is gay, we subconsciously expect that the actor is gay in real life too - especially if the actor appears in a long-running series. However, the above is not usually the case, because actors these days play any role, regardless of the sexual orientation of the character in the script.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here are 20 characters that audiences think, or have been tempted to assume, are gay, because of how convincing they are in their roles. Whether or not you believe these actors are brave is your opinion, but we can all agree that these and many more out there have something special about them, right?</p><h2 id=20-bridget-regan-rose-solano-in-jane-the-virgin><strong>20. Bridget Regan (Rose Solano in Jane the Virgin)</strong></h2><p>Fans of Jane the Virgin know Bridget Regan as Rose Solano or Sin Rostro. In the TV series, Bridget is a former lawyer, a stepmother to Luisa and Rafael Solano and she is the master faceless criminal known as Sin Rostro. What would make someone think that Bridget is gay is that she has a secret love affair with her stepdaughter Luisa Solano, and her role as a lesbian hiding her identity and sexual orientation is very convincing. However, in real life, Bridget Regan is actually straight; she and her husband Eamon O'Sullivan, an assistant director, have a daughter together.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=19-patrick-sabongui-captain-david-singh-in-the-flash><strong>19.

In the Series, Patrick Sabongui plays the role of a Central City Police Department captain called David Singh. David Singh is gay and has a fianc√© named Rob. However, in real life, Patrick Sabongui is straight.&nbsp;He got married to his wife Kyra Zagorsky in 2002, and they have two children.</p><p></p><h2 id=18-andrea-parker-sarah-souders-in-red-band-society><strong>18. Andrea Parker (Sarah Souders in Red Band Society)</strong></h2><p>The very first medical drama to focus on patients as opposed to doctors is a teen medical drama called Red Band Society.

In the series, Andrea Parker plays the role of Sarah Souders, mother of one of the teenagers. Sarah Souders is gay, and at times comes to the hospital with her partner to visit their daughter. In real life, Andrea is not gay; she got married to Michael Birnbaum in 2007.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=17-viola-davis-annalise-keating-in-how-to-get-away-with-murder><strong>17. Viola Davis (Annalise Keating in How to Get Away with Murder)</strong></h2><p>Fans of ABC's How to Get Away with Murder know <a href=#>Viola Davis</a> as Annalise Keating, a university law professor at Middleton University and one of the best defense attorneys in her city. Even though Annalise has so many enemies owing to her profession, she has lovers across both genders. In the second season of How to Get Away with Murder, the introduction of Annalise's former lover Eve Rothlo makes the audience question whether she is gay or not. These two women have passionate lovemaking scenes that are so convincing that one might think that the two are actually gay in real life, but that is just good acting. Viola Davis has been married to Julius Tennon for over 12 years now and they have three children together.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=16-brendan-fehr-drew-allister-in-the-night-shift><strong>16. Brendan Fehr (Drew Allister in The Night Shift)</strong></h2><p>Despite the mixed to average reviews&nbsp;The Night Shift has received from critics, this medical drama series is very popular with the audiences. NBC continues to air this show that is in its&nbsp;third season, a show that focuses on the lives of the night shift staff working at San Antonio Medical Center's emergency room. Brendan Fehr plays the role of Dr. Drew Allister, a gay character who is an active army medic and who hid his sexual orientation from everyone around him because he did not know how his friends would react. Brendan plays this role so convincingly that hardly would anyone think that he is straight in real life. The truth is that Brendan Fehr married Jennifer Rowley in 2006 and they have three children together.</p><p></p><h2 id=15-juan-pablo-raba-joey-gutierrez-in-agents-of-s-h-i-e-l-d><strong>15. Juan Pablo Raba (Joey Gutierrez in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)</strong></h2><p>Any production that has anything to do with Marvel Comics is sure to be a hit, owing to the huge following that Marvel has all over the world.

The series explores the relationship and research that Dr. William Masters and Virginia Johnson had as they conducted their research on human sexuality in St. Louis, Missouri's Washington University. The drama, the narrative detours, and the invented characters make the series a very interesting watch. Annaleigh Ashford plays the role of Betty Dimello, a gay character in the series. People who only know her from the show only know her as a gay woman, but in real life, Annaleigh Ashford is married to Joe Tapper.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-laura-prepon-alex-vause-in-orange-is-the-new-black><strong>13. Laura Prepon (Alex Vause in Orange Is the New Black)</strong></h2><p>To say that Orange is the New Black is popular is a bit of an understatement because this show is by far the most watched Netflix original series to date, with audiences not just in America but also all over the world. The series is based around women inmates in a minimum-security federal prison. <a href=#>Laura Prepon</a> plays the role of protagonist Piper Chapman's lover, a relationship that has been on and off throughout the three seasons already aired. Since this series is so popular, hardly would anyone think that Laura Prepon is straight. However, the truth is that Prepon is straight in real life.</p><p></p><h2 id=12-samantha-mathis-alice-calvert-in-under-the-dome><strong>12. Samantha Mathis (Alice Calvert in Under the Dome)</strong></h2><p>Under the Dome was a great fictional series that ended in September 2015, depicting the events of people in a small town called Chester's Mill that were trapped under a huge indestructible alien dome.

Sherri Saum plays the role of Lena Adam-Foster, a vice-principal at Anchor Beach Community Charter School who is bringing up the children together with her wife Stefanie Adams Foster. Although Sherri plays her role as a lesbian in a very convincing way, in real life, she is straight and is married to Kamar de Los Reyes and they have two children.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-katrina-law-nyssa-al-ghul-in-arrow><strong>10.
