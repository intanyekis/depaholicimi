Despite her efforts to rally some of the houseguests to vote in her favor, Kirsten found herself on the receiving end of a unanimous vote. With no allies in the game, she became an easy target for the other contestants. It was a tough break for Kirsten, who didn’t even get a chance to experience life in the jury house.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Week_2_%E2%80%93_Reilly_Smedley></span>Week 2 – Reilly Smedley<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ndtmusic.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/reilly-big-brother-1692323963055.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>In Week 2, Reilly Smedley, who had held the Head of Household position, was sent packing. It seemed like a case of karma catching up to her, as she had spent the previous week convincing the houseguests to vote out Kirsten. The other players saw this as an opportunity to strike back and unanimously voted for Reilly’s eviction. It was a reminder that alliances can quickly shift in the game of Big Brother.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Week_3_%E2%80%93_Hisam_Goueli></span>Week 3 – Hisam Goueli<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ndtmusic.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/hisam-goueli-1692929493361.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>Week 3 brought another unanimous eviction in the form of Hisam Goueli. With an 11-0 vote, Hisam was sent home from the Big Brother house. While fans were sad to see him go, Hisam’s reaction to discovering a secret between Cirie and Jared provided some comedic relief.

However, due to the Power of Invincibility being used, Jag was able to stay in the house. This led to a unique situation where the entire house, including the outgoing Head of Household, had to compete in the HoH competition. It was a tense week for all the contestants as they fought to secure their positions in the game.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Week_5_%E2%80%93_Red_Utley></span>Week 5 – Red Utley<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ndtmusic.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/red-big-brother-1694137568474.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>Breaking away from the pattern of unanimous evictions, Red Utley was voted out of the Big Brother house with a vote of 8-2 in Week 5.
