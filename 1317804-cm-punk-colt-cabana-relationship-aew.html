The two men were long-time close friends, but they had a falling out and were subsequently locked in a heated court case. Company president Tony Khan previously stated that <a href=#>Punk had nothing to do with Cabana moving to ROH</a>.</p><p>During a <a href=# rel=noopener>media scrum after AEW All Out</a>, Punk commented on the issues. He emphasized that he hasn’t had anything to do with Cabana in a long time and explained why they stopped being friends in the first place.</p><p>“Okay, so you fancy yourself a journalist,” Punk said. “Would you say you’re friends with Scott Colten? So you’re not friends with him. Oh wow. That makes two of us. My point is, if you fancy yourself a journalist, even if it’s for the silly world of professional wrestling, and you have journalist integrity, people who report things, mostly that are bulls—-, and slanders, lies against myself, if you are friends with somebody, my spot, if you’re not friends with them, I apologize. But you should probably disclose who you’re friends with.</p><p>“I haven’t had anything to do with Scott Colten in almost a decade,&nbsp; probably wanted nothing to do with him even longer than that. It’s f—- unfortunate that I have to come up here and speak on this when I’m on my time and this is a f— business. Why I’m a grown-ass adult man, and I decide not to be friends with somebody is nobody else’s f—- business. But my friends, if I fall backwards will catch me. Scott Colten I felt never would have. My problem was, I wanted to bring a guy with me to the top that did not want to see me at the top, okay. You can call it jealously, you can call it envy, whatever the f— it is.”</p><p>He continued by making it clear that he hasn’t had a relationship with Cabana ended a long time ago, and he doesn’t care where he works now. He then questioned what he deserves to have a “dumb f—” like Hangman Page go into business for himself on national television.</p><p>“My relationship with Scott Colten ended long before I paid all of his bills,” said Punk. “I have every receipt, I have every invoice, I have every email. I have the email where he says and I quote, ‘I agree to go online separate ways, I will get my own lawyer, and you do not have to pay anymore.’ That’s an email that I have. The only reason the public did not see is because when I finally had to counter sue him, through discovery, we discovered he shared a bank account with his mother. That’s a fact, and as soon as we discovered that fact and we subpoenaed old Marsha, he sent the email, ‘Oh, can we please drop all this?’ Now, it’s 2022, I haven’t been friends with this guy since at least 2014, late 2013. The fact that I have to sit up here because we have irresponsible people who call themselves EVPs and couldn’t f—- manage a target, and they spread lies and bull—- and put into the media that I got somebody fired when I have f— all to do with him, want nothing to do with him, do not care where he works, where he doesn’t work, where he eats, where he eats.”</p><p>“The fact that I have to get up here and do this in 2022 is f— embarrassing. If y’all are at fault, f— you. If you’re not, I apologize. But what did I ever do in this world to deserve an empty-headed f— dumb f— like Hangman Page to go out on national television and f— go into business for himself, for what? What did I do? What did I ever do? Didn’t do a goddamned thing.”</p><p>Khan spoke up and stated that he should have made the situation clear, but Punk emphasized that he shouldn’t have had to. He stated that the people who “call themselves” EVPs should have known better. Khan tried to say that he should have n-commented the question, but Punk sated that he’s trying to run a business. He noted that while the situaton is beyond apologizes, he’ll still readily take up an issue with anyone that comes to him.</p><p>“It’s not his position to make it very f—- clear,” Punk said. “There’s people who call themselves EVPs that should have f—- known better. The s— was none of their business. I understand sticking up for your f— friends, I f— get it. I stuck up for that guy more then anybody, okay. I paid his bills until I didn’t, and it was my decision not to.&nbsp;I’m trying to run a f— business, but somebody who hasn’t done a damn thing in this business jeopardizes the first million-dollar house that this company has ever drawn off of my back and goes on national television and does that, it’s a disgrace to this industry, it’s a disgrace to this company.</p><p>“Now we’re far behind apologies. I gave him a f— chance. It did not get handled, and you saw what I had to do, which was was very regrettable, lowering myself to his f— level. But that’s where we’re at right now. I will still walk up and down this hallway and say, ‘If you have a f— problem with me, take it up with me. Let’s f— go.”</p><p>Punk subsequently offered another comment, saying that the lawsuit was Cabana’s “funeral.”</p><p>“I’ve never spoken this word in I don’t know how long, so I’m a little f—- pissed off about it,” Punk said. “When it came down that he was gonna sue me, I asked to talk to him. He refused. I asked for mediation, it was denied. I offered him money, he said it was not enough. He went ahead with the lawsuit and suit. It’s his f— funeral. I don’t care. He shares a bank account with his mother. Tells you all you need to know about what kind of character that is.”</p><p>He also elaborated on his comments about the EVPs and noted they were “stepping on [their[ own d—” through their actions.</p><p>“I’ll tell you why I’m upset about it,” Punk said. “Because if you’re an EVP, you try to not middle your top babyface to try and get your niche audience that’s on the internet to hate him for some made-up, bulls— rumor. Really pisses me off, stepping on your own d—-, trying to f—- make money, sell tickets and fill arenas. These stupid guys think they’re in Reseda.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJqbnFoZGKwrnnPrqWkZZOkubV5wpqZmqaRYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnAnq4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kelly-ripa-tan-luxe-self-tanning-drops-skincare-amazon.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kelly Ripa Gets Her Sunkissed Complexion From This Tan-Luxe Product</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nyt-connections-hints-and-answers-for-november-20-2023-15985.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>NYT Connections Hints and Answers for November 20 2023</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-mariah-careys-worst-outfits-that-prove-she-has-no-fashion-taste.html>15 Of Mariah Carey's Worst Outfits That Prove She Has No Fashion Taste</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heres-how-much-the-cast-members-of-euphoria-make-per-episode.html>Here's How Much The Cast Members Of Euphoria Make Per Episode</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-bonet.html>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-belzer-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Richard Belzer obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX.
