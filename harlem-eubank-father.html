They want to know how he is connected to Simon Eubank.</strong></p><p>Harlem Eubank is a name that has been recently trending in the boxing industry.&nbsp;He competes in the super lightweight category.</p><p>Eubank, who comes from a well-known boxing family, will try to step out from under the spotlight cast by his renowned relatives.</p><h2>Is Harlem Eubank Father Simon Eubank His Trainer?</h2><p>Harlem Eubank was born in Brighton on February 23, 1993. His Father’s name is Simon Eubank. It seems like he has always looked upto his dad when it comes to fighting.&nbsp;</p><p>Simon competed as a professional fighter between 1984 and 1992, earning seven wins and 20 losses. In January 1992, Kevin Lueshing defeated him via TKO4 to win his final bout as a professional.</p><p>After winning the IBO World Welterweight Title, Lueshing subsequently challenged Felix Trinidad for the IBF World Welterweight Title.</p><p>Simon Eubank is the brother of Chris Eubank Sr., a retired British professional boxer who competed from 1985 to 1998.</p><p>He captured the middleweight and super-middleweight championships of the WBO between 1990 and 1995.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/modelfact.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NINTCHDBPICT000643564795.jpg><p>Chris ranks as the third-best British super-middleweight fighter of all time, as per BoxRec.</p><p>Simon and Chris Sr. also have a brother called Peter and a sister named Jocelyn. Irvin and Ena Eubank were their parents. The odd Sussex family has a long history of fighting.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Who Is Matthew T. Eyet?

However, talking about his family, his family has a history of boxing.&nbsp;</p><p>Simon Eubank, a professional boxer and the eldest sibling of Chris Eubank Sr., is the Father of Harlem.</p><p>Unlike Chris Jr., who made his professional debut, was accompanied to the ring by his Father, and gained attention after flexing and posturing while wearing a sleeveless suit, Harlem began his career in front of sparsely populated York Halls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/modelfact.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NINTCHDBPICT000707825628.jpg><p>In contrast to their younger sibling, Simon and Peter Eubank were not hailed as two-weight world champions.</p><p>The two were hired as bodies to fight against the House combatant for a small portion of the millions Chris Sr. would make. They were genuine journeymen.</p><p>Despite the unusual surprise, both of them had pitifully poor losing records. (Peter Eubank once defeated a young Barry McGuigan).</p><p>Chris Sr. once frequently blamed his open hatred of the sport on the experiences of his older twin siblings.</p><h2>Harlem Eubank Net Worth</h2><p>Harlem Eubank’s net worth is not yet exactly available to the public. However, we can assume that he earns a decent amount of income from his boxing career.</p><p>Harlem has a 15-0 record while remaining unstoppable. From those fights, he has earned four takeout victories.&nbsp;He is a straightforward guy as well.</p><p>His last name has a long history in the fighting world. These benefits, though, also come with increased strain.</p><p>Harlem Eubank, Chris Eubank Jr.’s cousin, recognized this example early in his career and didn’t seem odd to his competitors, who were attempting to take everything away from him before he reached the top.</p><p>The super-lightweight fighter, who has won all 16 of his fights, will face Miguel Antin on Friday night at York Corridor in London.</p><p>He also said, “When I fight, I need to dazzle, and I feel like my style is always energizing to witness, so I think I’ll put on a fantastic show on Walk 31.”</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong><a href=#> Who Is Edu Manzano?
