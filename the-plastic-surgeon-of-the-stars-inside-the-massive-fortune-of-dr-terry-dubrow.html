In fact, he had his heart set on becoming a cardiologist and wanted to specialize in surgical heart procedures. While he was pursuing his medical education, he learned of a woman whose face was badly disfigured in a car crash, and he quickly realized the benefits of plastic surgery. Motivated by the desire to help people regain their lives, Dubrow moved forward to pursue studies in the realm of plastic surgery procedures, and&nbsp; most would agree; this is the greatest re-direct his career could have seen. He is now sitting atop a massive fortune, and seems to truly love the work he does on a daily basis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmetic Catastrophe: 10 Botched Celebrity Surgeries</a></span></p><h2 id=his-plastic-surgery-skills-become-a-reality-tv-phenomenon>His Plastic Surgery Skills Become A Reality TV Phenomenon</h2><p>Terry Dubrow's career was an instant success, and he was progressing well as a deeply respected, and highly esteemed plastic surgeon.

Before long, the world was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">starting to take notice </a>of his work and his undeniably charming on-camera presence, and the opportunities for him to engage in more reality based television shows began to expand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before long, Dr. Dubrow was signed on to star in what would soon become a hit show that would generate interest across the nation, a show called Botched. The premise of the show was to highlight people that have suffered from botched and unsuccessful surgical procedures that left them scarred, disfigured, and feeling completely insecure about their appearance. Dr. Terry Dubrow and his business partner Dr. Paul Nassif, were there to swoop in and save the day, performing life-altering surgeries that were designed to repair the damage done by less experienced surgeons.</p><p>Fans simply couldn't get enough of the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> miraculous transformations</a> that they were witnessing at as a result&nbsp;of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dubrow's skillful surgical procedures.</a>&nbsp; The 'before' and 'after' images were dramatically different, and the show was an instant hit.</p><p>Dubrow then signed on for the spinoff show, Botched By Nature, which saw an equally impressive fan following and became the new addiction for many.</p><h2 id=his-unmatched-reputation>His Unmatched Reputation</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dubrow has gone on to participate in a number of other television specials inclusive of Bridalplasty and Good Work, and his reputation has been recognized and respected by fans across the globe.
