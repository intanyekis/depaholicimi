I’m sure Kim could clear up what really happened, and why she did what she did, but I don’t think she wants to revisit that particular situation,” the source continued. “It would just open up a whole new can of worms and she’s truly moved on.”</p><p>Kim released footage of Taylor appearing to agree to the lyrics in Kanye’s song “Famous,” which include derogatory comments about her. Taylor has denied approving of the lyrics, before they came out, launching fans to choose a side. The singer says she faced a lot of backlash online for the feud, leaving her on tenuous terms with Kim and Kanye today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ttweb_a-look-at-kim-kardashian-s-net-worth-since-divorcing-kanye-west_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="A Look At Kim Kardashian's Net Worth Since Divorcing Kanye West">A Look At Kim Kardashian's Net Worth Since Divorcing Kanye West</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Kim Kardashian knows how to leverage her fame, so it's no wonder her divorce has barely made a dent in her net worth.</p><p>“That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year,” Taylor said last December of the feud. “I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore.

Even her current beau Travis Kelce appears to get a few shout-outs, despite only debuting their relationship a few months ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdoLauecqaqZ2Zo522orqMrKClnZ6perTDyJ%2Brop2jYq61wMCcomarn5i2oriMppydoZGoerWt2KWmq6tdmba0v4ytqZqbm6h8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-harris.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>chris harris - Wrestlezone</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-50-billion-dollar-man-how-dan-pena-made-his-multi-million-dollar-fortune.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 50 Billion Dollar Man: How Dan Pea Made His Multi-Million-Dollar Fortune</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-mariah-careys-worst-outfits-that-prove-she-has-no-fashion-taste.html>15 Of Mariah Carey's Worst Outfits That Prove She Has No Fashion Taste</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heres-how-much-the-cast-members-of-euphoria-make-per-episode.html>Here's How Much The Cast Members Of Euphoria Make Per Episode</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-bonet.html>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-belzer-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Richard Belzer obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX.
