He confessed he had lied to his then-wife over the fear of losing her and breaking the family apart.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, I just didn’t know how to. I was just too scared about losing everything, losing her, losing the family. I just didn’t know how.</p><p>Another aspect addressed in the interview was the actor’s decision to keep Mildred in their house, even after the affair.</p><p>He iterated that it was the best way he could have handled everything, adding that dismissing her would have been unjust. He then added that he was optimistic for a reconciliation.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Schwarzenegger also&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">has</a> four children — Patrick, Katherine, Christina, and Christopher with Shriver. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Baena Turned Out Exactly like Schwarzenegger</h2><p>In Schwarzenegger’s book,&nbsp;Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story,&nbsp;he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">recalled</a> the moment he learned of his son Baena. The politician confessed that he tried to convince himself that Mildred’s husband was the child’s father.</p><p>However, as Baena grew up, Schwarzenegger noticed&nbsp;he looked just like him. The actor wrote that it was indisputable who Baena’s father was.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Although the actor considers the affair a mistake, he has taken care of Joseph.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only is their&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">resemblance</a>&nbsp;clear, especially because Baena has the same swole physique as his father, but he also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">followed</a> Schwarzenegger&nbsp;into&nbsp;the bodybuilding world.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In an interview with Howard Stern on his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">SiriusXM</a>&nbsp;radio show, Schwarzenegger said he had a “fantastic” relationship with all his children, including Joseph. “Joseph’s terrific, and he totally understands the situation,” he added.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Baena too&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">gushed</a>&nbsp;about his father in an interview with Hollywood Life, stating he had nothing negative to say about his father and how they spend a lot of time together.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2B8tLHPoWSbmZWjrm6ywK2fnqpencGuuA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./socialite-corazon-kwamboka-calls-it-quits-with-frankie.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Socialite Corazon Kwamboka Calls it Quits with Frankie Months After Engagement</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-van-jefferson-related-to-justin-jefferson-family-tree-and-net-worth-difference.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Van Jefferson Related To Justin Jefferson?
