And then we were, like everyone, <a href=#>kind of [were] off and on for a while</a> and then once we got to college it got really serious.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jaguars-QB-Trevor-Lawrence-How-I-Knew-My-Wife-Marissa-Mowry-Was-The-One-0001.jpg><p class=p1>As Lawrence and Mowry, 23, continued their relationship while studying at Clemson University and Anderson University, respectively, the NFL star became <a href=#>“pretty confident” that marriage was in their future</a>.</p><p class=p1>“That’s what I wanted to do and she felt the same way,” Lawrence gushed to&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>on Friday. “So that’s why we got married young and we’re just excited. It’s <a href=#>fun to have your person with you through</a> all the different stuff that we’ve gone through. It’s been cool.&nbsp;I’ve known her for a long time … [and] we’ve kind of seen the best and the worst in each other and it’s been fun. It’s been really awesome just to, like, get to know her more and more. I wouldn’t trade that for anything.”</p><p class=p1>Lawrence and the event planner <a href=#>went on to get married in April 2021</a> — and their romance has since continued to heat up.</p><p class=p1>“We <a href=#>try to do some version of a date night</a>, whether that’s going out or that’s ordering in and just hanging out and having a glass of wine or whatever just to try to spend that time together,” the Georgia native said on Friday, joking that he should “probably” up <a href=#>the number of grand gestures that he does</a> for Mowry. “‘Cause during the week it gets kind of busy and then, especially, when we have families coming in town on the weekends and that’s even busier. We’ve gotten better and better at making time, making sure that we have time together and really prioritizing that.”</p><p class=p1>While the newlyweds are currently basking in married bliss, Lawrence teased to&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>that they “definitely” <a href=#>hope to have kids “one day.”</a></p><p class=p1>“I don’t know when that’s gonna be. I <a href=#>think we’re gonna wait a little while</a>,” the professional football player said. “We’ve really just enjoyed not having the responsibility of having kids [right now]. … I wouldn’t say near future, but in the future. So, probably in the next few years. We’re just enjoying where we’re at and we wanna travel and be able to do all that before we kind of settle down.”</p><p class=p1>In the meantime, Lawrence is gearing up for <a href=#>Super Bowl LVII</a> and <a href=#>watching the big game</a> alongside Mowry and their friends.</p><p class=p1>“I’m gonna be in Arizona and I’ll be watching the game with <strong>Christian Kirk</strong> and his fiancée,&nbsp; [<strong>Ozzy Ozkan</strong>], and my wife,” the quarterback told&nbsp;<i>Us</i>, referring to the <a href=#>Arizona Cardinals</a> athlete. “So we’ll all be together. So whatever they end up having at the house, hopefully they [get] some of [<a href=#>my favorite snacks</a>, including Buffalo chicken dip and nachos]. I’ll have to let them know.”</p><p class=p1>Lawrence, who confessed that he is rooting for the <a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a> over the <a href=#>Philadelphia Eagles</a> “just because they beat us,” further revealed <a href=#>his favorite Super Bowl traditions</a>.&nbsp;“Just getting together with friends. I think that’s the best part,” he said. “The game really is centered around food and hanging out and the better food you have, obviously it makes it a better experience.”</p><p class=p1>Lawrence has also teamed up with Tostitos, the official chip and dip of the NFL, to help one lucky fan throw the ultimate game day bash. Participants can enter the Tost by Tostitos <a href=#>sweepstakes</a> through February 8 for the chance to score a delivery of chips, dips and ingredients that are needed to recreate dishes hand-selected by Lawrence.</p><p class=p1>Additionally, Tost by Tostitos will host a pop-up restaurant <a href=#>outside the State Farm Stadium&nbsp;in Arizona</a>&nbsp;during the Super Bowl on Sunday, February 12.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“They’re basically using their different chips and snack items to create a food menu where you can order a full meal with their stuff, not just the chips and the dips and all that,” Lawrence explained on Friday. “So that’s gonna be really cool. I’m excited to try everything when I’m out there!”</p><p class=p1><i>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZOgwLC61aKjpZ1dn66owcCrqmasoprDsL6MpZiwqpWjsKZ505qjpKtdoq6ztdKsmGaln6y%2FunnMmqmroZGcsnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./peggy-zabakolas-wiki-age-husband-net-worth-height.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Age, Husband, Net Worth, Height, Parents, Siblings</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./si-robertson.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>From Vietnam Veteran to Reality TV Sensation</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-mariah-careys-worst-outfits-that-prove-she-has-no-fashion-taste.html>15 Of Mariah Carey's Worst Outfits That Prove She Has No Fashion Taste</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heres-how-much-the-cast-members-of-euphoria-make-per-episode.html>Here's How Much The Cast Members Of Euphoria Make Per Episode</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-bonet.html>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-belzer-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Richard Belzer obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX.
