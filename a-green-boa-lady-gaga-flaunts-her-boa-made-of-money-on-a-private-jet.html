Hard work, determination, and a strong fan following have led her down the path of this enormous fortune, and she's not afraid to flaunt it at every turn. In fact, she was just spotted wearing a very elaborate boa around her neck... and it was made entirely out of $100 bills. To add a little more flair to the already very poignant boa made of Benjamins, she sported this look on a private jet on her way to Las Vegas. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> reported on this unique look, adding it to the list of <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many wild fashion statements that have been made by the star.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Gaga's Financial Journey, From Bankruptcy, To $320 Million</a></span></p><p><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Gaga has always been 'loud' when it comes to her fashion statements</a> and hasn't been shy about wearing outfits that command attention for being bold and jarringly different than anything anyone would have ever expected.</p><p>When speaking of <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Gaga's fashion statements </a>over the years, it's apparent to all that she has boldly gone where no other fashionista has ever gone before.</p><p>She has worn everything from stunning, elegant gowns on the red carpet to her infamous 'meat dress' that was made entirely of raw beef, which she sported at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This time, her outfit is designed to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ooze wealth from every pore</a> and was made entirely out of $100 bills.</p><p>Lady Gaga posted her bizarre bill-boa to her Instagram page, and fans immediately made the connection.
