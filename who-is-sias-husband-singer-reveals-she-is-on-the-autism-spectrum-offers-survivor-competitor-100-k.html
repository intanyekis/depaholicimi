Only six people, including the bride and groom, were present for the ceremony.</p><p>The 'Cheap Thrills' singer has always kept her personal life private, previously hiding her face from the paparazzi by donning large wigs and just recently announcing that she is autistic. It's not surprising that she chose to marry her boyfriend Bernad in Italy in front of a small group of people. Sia, 47, recently revealed the details about her autism diagnosis on a 'Rob Has a Podcast' episode where Carolyn Wiger, a former 'Survivor' contestant, was a featured guest. "I'm on the spectrum, and I'm in recovery and whatever," Sia said. "There's a lot of things," according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CNN</a>.</p><h2 class=split>'We feel seen for the first time'</h2><p>Sia praised Wiger, a drug counselor, during the podcast and revealed she will give the former contestant $100,000 to support her and her son. Wiger praised Sia for being so honest as the 'Unstoppable' singer responded, "Being in recovery and also knowing about which kind of neurologicality you might have, or might not have, well..."</p><p>Sia continued, "I think one of the greatest things is that nobody can ever know you and love you when you're filled with secrets and... living in shame." She had previously admitted that she had sought substance abuse treatment.</p><p>"When we finally sit in a room full of strangers and tell them our deepest, darkest, most shameful secrets and everybody laughs along with us, and we don't feel like pieces of trash for the first time, we feel seen for the first time in our lives for who we actually are and then we can start going out into the world as operators just operating as humans," she added.</p><h2 class=split>'I've got to go put my human suit on'</h2><p>Sia appeared to suggest that she only lately became aware that she has autism. "For 45 years, I was like... 'I've got to go put my human suit on'. And only in the last two years have I become fully, fully myself."</p><p>Sia has previously received criticism in 2021 for using neurotypical dancer and actress Maddie Ziegler, a longtime collaborator of hers, to play an autistic character in the film 'Music'. She said, "I realized it wasn't ableism, I mean it is ableism I guess as well, but it's actually nepotism because I can't do a project without her. I don't want to. I wouldn't make art if it didn't include her."&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Who is Sia's husband?&nbsp;</h2><p>Sia married her producer boyfriend Bernad in front of four guests in Italy on Monday, May 8. Bernad and her, however, kept their romance out of the spotlight; they have only made one public appearance when they made a red carpet appearance for 'West Side Story'. It is unclear when the two started dating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/29e1e81e-1e48-4ed5-afd1-26cb7a955e65.1357815410><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKygmqtdncK0rsCnm2armaO0pr6Mq5yvnZGhwG6%2Fx55koqtdpLtuwMeeZJqtpJ7ArnnSqZycrKKqum67xZ%2Bcq6tdqMKzwsivpqtlk6S6sbHToquoql1mfXF5yg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./15-things-about-beyonce-we-dont-pay-attention-to-but-should.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Things About Beyonc We Don't Pay Attention To (But Should)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-jalen-hurts-agent-nicole-lynn-619211-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Jalen Hurts agent Nicole Lynn?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-mariah-careys-worst-outfits-that-prove-she-has-no-fashion-taste.html>15 Of Mariah Carey's Worst Outfits That Prove She Has No Fashion Taste</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heres-how-much-the-cast-members-of-euphoria-make-per-episode.html>Here's How Much The Cast Members Of Euphoria Make Per Episode</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-bonet.html>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-belzer-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Richard Belzer obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX.
