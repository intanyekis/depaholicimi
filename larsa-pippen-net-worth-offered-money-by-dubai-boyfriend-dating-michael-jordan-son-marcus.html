Rumors spiked even more when the two were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted kissing at Miami Beach</a> in January 2023. Eventually, they finally confirmed their relationship on Instagram that same month. So far, the new couple are doing great and have created a podcast together called Separation Anxiety with Larsa Pippen and Marcus Jordan. The podcast explores everything under the sun regarding Larsa Pippen and Marcus Jordan's experience of being in a relationship with a significant age gap (16 years) as well as their thoughts and opinions on cultural topics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In their episode titled "Larcus Tells All," Larsa Pippen reveals an interesting encounter she had with a guy in Dubai she was casually talking to, and if it wasn't for her relationship with Marcus Jordan, she could've easily fallen into a significant amount of money.</p><h2 id=larsa-pippen-could-have-been-richer-if-it-wasn-39-t-for-her-dating-marcus-jordan>Larsa Pippen Could Have Been Richer If It Wasn't For Her Dating Marcus Jordan</h2><p>Even though being the ex-wife of Scottie Pippen afforded her a lot of money from spousal support, Larsa Pippen could have made bank if she wasn't romantically involved with Marcus Jordan, NBA legend Michael Jordan's son.</p><p>This claim is due to the fact that Larsa Pippen was offered money to not engage with other men by a guy in Dubai she was casually talking to, according to Essentially Sports. On Separation Anxiety with Larsa Pippen and Marcus Jordan, Larsa Pippen said that the Dubai man offered to send her a large sum of money monthly in exchange for her loyalty.</p><p>"I remember talking to a guy once. We were probably talking for two months... probably by [the] second or third conversation, he was like 'hey, I would send you money every month.
