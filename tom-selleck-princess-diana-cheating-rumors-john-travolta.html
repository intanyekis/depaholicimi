According to what Selleck wrote in his book, he was put in an awkward position after being <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>asked to save Princess Diana from scandal</strong></a>.</p><p>In Selleck's book, he wrote about when he danced with Princess Diana at a 1985 White House dinner.

Amid Princess Diana and Prince Charles' unhappy marriage, she reportedly had an affair with Army Captain James Hewitt from 1986 until 1990.</p><p>In response, the member of Princess Diana's team became more insistent that Travolta had to be stopped.
