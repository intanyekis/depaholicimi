They became close very quickly, resulting in their marriage in December 1993.</p><h2 id=shania-married-her-first-husband-and-made-music-magic>Shania Married Her First Husband And Made Music Magic</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shania Twain — born Eileen Regina Edwards — was adopted by her stepfather Jerry Twain after her mother remarried when the singer was only four years old.</p><p>Her name was Eileen Twain until she was signed to a record label in 1992. Only then did she change her name to Shania — an Ojibwa word that meant ‘on my way.’</p><p>And she was on her way; Shania’s marriage to Mutt Lange was the consequence of what could only be called a whirlwind romance.</p><p>The fact that they had a spark cannot be denied considering that their first call lasted for three hours during which they were just singing or playing their original songs to each other. They had their first and only child Eja (pronounced Asia) D’Angelo Lange on August 12, 2001.</p><p>“I didn’t want to be too forward,” Shania said about her first call with Mutt, in her Netflix documentary Not Just A Girl in which she revealed her worst fears, “but in my mind, I’m saying, ‘Oh wow, if this guy made my music sound like that, that would be the dream’.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The No One Needs To Know singer’s career reached new heights with the release of her second album The Woman In Me, which she either wrote or co-wrote with Lange.</p><p>The couple’s chemistry garnered four albums: The Woman in Me (1995), Come On Over (1997), Up!

Frédéric was the first person to find out about the affair through receipts and phone bills in his wife’s suitcase.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I did discover the affair with my wife and Mutt," Thiébaud had told Oprah Winfrey. "I said, 'Guys, now you have to tell [Shania]. This is ridiculous.
