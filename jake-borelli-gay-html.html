You don’t belong’ builds up, and it built up over time.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He felt alone and sensed a disconnect because of the absence of queer characters. Further, it wasn’t uncommon for actors who came out as gay to have difficulty landing roles. As a result, he decided to stay in the closet. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Borelli was&nbsp;closeted&nbsp;for almost a decade of his career. However, he has now acknowledged that he regrets that decision.&nbsp;</p><p>It made me feel even more alone to not have anyone to confide in and to feel like if I wanted a career, or if I wanted to be successful in the way that I wanted to, I’d have to hide a huge part of myself. It was a struggle for a really long time—and then I booked Grey’s.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>His character on the show, Dr. Schmitt, was an instant success, but when showrunner Krista Vernoff got in touch with him about the character coming out on the show, his old traumas and the terrifying feeling of him losing everything came flooding back. As a result, he did not say yes right away.&nbsp;</p><p>As his confidence was shaking, he got to thinking about all the young queer people who did not have a gay lead to look up to and felt like they were not fully represented. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>So he called up his parents, and when his dad told him how he would feel lighter after being a part of something that terrified him, he immediately decided to get on with it.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>He Came Out, And It Changed His Life</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He came out as gay on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">social</a>&nbsp;media the same night his character did. Fortunately, the reaction was overwhelmingly positive for reel and real life.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Now he feels that if only he had watched the&nbsp;show&nbsp;when he was younger, it would have made him more confident and less afraid.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Since coming out, he has also done magazine&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">covers</a>, which admittedly he did not believe would happen.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In addition to that, Borelli has also&nbsp;starred&nbsp;in Freeform’s first gay romantic comedy,&nbsp;The Thing About Harry, which received good reviews from the audience. Admittedly, coming out was one of the best decisions of his life.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2BurLGMm6arnZyhtm6zwLJloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./232611-melissa-benoists-ex-spouse-blake-jenner-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Melissa Benoist's Ex-spouse Blake Jenner Admits to Hurting Her inside Their Short Marriage</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./heidi-klums-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Heidi Klums Net Worth (Updated 2022): Model Television Host Television Producer Earnings!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-mariah-careys-worst-outfits-that-prove-she-has-no-fashion-taste.html>15 Of Mariah Carey's Worst Outfits That Prove She Has No Fashion Taste</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heres-how-much-the-cast-members-of-euphoria-make-per-episode.html>Here's How Much The Cast Members Of Euphoria Make Per Episode</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-bonet.html>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-belzer-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Richard Belzer obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX.
