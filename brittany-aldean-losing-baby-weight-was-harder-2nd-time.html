I held on to almost a solid 20 pounds.”</p><p>Brittany became extra intentional about watching what she ate, explaining to Us, “I feel like you’re so tired and you’re just trying to keep this little baby alive that you kind of forget about what you’re doing for yourself in that mix. So I finally just had to focus on myself and really think about what I was eating, the activity that I was taking in. It eventually started to come off.”</p><p>The University of Alabama graduate has been eating South Beach meals and snacks with “high protein and low fat.” She shared with Us, “My indulgence is wine. I&nbsp;pick my times to indulge a little bit and have a higher calorie intake. Lower fats, lower carbs.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Brittany-Aldean-Losing-Baby-Weight-Harder-Second-Time-3.jpg><p>Brittany is now “bigger than before” she had kids, but is “OK with it.” She told Us, “I gained 40 pounds with each.
