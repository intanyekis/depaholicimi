Just two guys who are friends and whatever character I did over the last three, four years going into that kind of got washed away. And in some respects, I think that happened.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/PAY_09022023GD_47110.jpg><p>Zayn, 39, started to change his mind as their run together progressed, as they started stacking up quality match after quality match against some combination of The Judgement Day’s Finn Balor, Damian Priest and Dominik Mysterio that left him “proud” of their work.</p><p>It culminated with Priest and Balor beating them for the titles at Payback,&nbsp;ending their reign after six months and two pay-per-view defenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A little more than a month later, Owens was traded from Raw to SmackDown as part of storyline compensation for Jey Uso, and he Zayn were on their own again.</p><p>Zayn felt there were still a few fun avenues for them to explore as a team, especially with Owens going into spontaneous fits of frustration at wrestlers breaking some of the silly unwritten rules of WWE, such as coming into scenes before their name was mentioned.</p><p>“Only once we were coming towards the tail end of the run did I feel like, ‘Oh wait, we’re starting to hit a bit of a stride here,’” Zayn said. “This feels a bit different from past times where we’ve teamed. It felt like we were starting to hit something a little different and then it ended and we lost the titles.”</p><p>Zayn, who will team with Randy Orton, Seth Rollins, Cody Rhodes and Uso against The Judgment Day and Drew McIntyre at Survivor Series, had some ideas for where he and Owens could have gone as champions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/PAY_09022023HM_26665.jpg><p>“I do think there is more we could have done with the tag team titles and I think there is a lot of fun character stuff to explore that we never really got to explore,” he said. “For example, when Kevin was having those enraged sorts of outbursts, I thought there was a lot of really fun stuff we could have done that was entertaining. I had all kinds of ideas to go to counseling and all kinds of things. That never really got to happen.”</p><p>One thing about how WWE broke him and Owens up pleased Zayn greatly.&nbsp;</p><p>Neither one of them turned on the other like they had in the past and it didn’t lead to a singles match or any kind of feud between them.&nbsp;</p><p>Zayn said he was “glad that didn’t happen.”</p><p>Now their story is they are still friends working on different shows, able to come back to their storied relationship when the time is right.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m kind of pleased with the fact we kind of went in separate directions in a way that isn’t similar to ways we have done it in the past where one guy invariably turns on the other and then get into a program with each other once again,” Zayn said.</p><p>“I’m sure Kevin and I will wrestle once again and one of the keys to kind of keeping it fresh over the years is a little time and space, a breathing room in between so those characters can evolve in their own ways and then when the reconvene you seeing different versions of those two guys from the last time you saw them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpma2xfqL2wvtOsZrCvlah6tK3MomSzmamjerC6jLCfsmWknba0ecqeraKmXaTEprrSZquemZ1iwrF51pqqZpyZm7OmvsSnq2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zpm-24k-gold-serum-skincare-anti-aging-affordable-amazon.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>ZPM 24K Gold Serum May 'Activate' Youthful, Healthy Skin</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tricia-duncan.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tricia Duncan</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-mariah-careys-worst-outfits-that-prove-she-has-no-fashion-taste.html>15 Of Mariah Carey's Worst Outfits That Prove She Has No Fashion Taste</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heres-how-much-the-cast-members-of-euphoria-make-per-episode.html>Here's How Much The Cast Members Of Euphoria Make Per Episode</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-bonet.html>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-belzer-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Richard Belzer obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX.
