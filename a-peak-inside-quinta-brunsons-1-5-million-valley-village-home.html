The Philadelphia native first became famous when her memes and skits went viral on Instagram. Her comedic timing was obvious but it was her passion for writing smart skits and memes that got her jobs at BuzzFeed, A Black Lady Sketch Show, and Netflix’s Big Mouth. Nowadays, the <a href=#>Abbott Elementary star’s net worth</a> is close to $5 million and she’s spending her riches on luxury, including a San Fernando Valley home. After moving to Los Angeles from Philadelphia, Brunson is living large.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Abbott Elementary&nbsp;swept awards season and has been renewed for a third season. Starring in the show—on top of being an executive producer, writer, and creator—has only made Brunson more well-known in Hollywood because of her talents. High on her earnings, Brunson bought her dream home after growing up on the opposite side of the country.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>12 Highest Grossing Warner Bros.

Valley Village is an area within Los Angeles that’s not far from Warner Bros. Studio, which is where Abbott Elementary is filmed on a sound stage, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Distractify</a>. For $1.5 million, Brunson hit the lottery with this chic and private West Coast home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brunson lives in the 1960s home with her husband, Kevin Jay Anik. A <a href=#>peek inside the Los Angeles home</a> shows 2,168 square feet and resides on 0.14 acres with plenty of curb appeal. Brunson can host gatherings at her single-story home due to the open floor plan and naturally lit rooms. The modern-designed house opens up to a spacious backyard with a pool and plenty of green space. The property has&nbsp;plenty of privacy because of the redwood fence and tall trees surrounding the home.</p><h2 id=la-dreaming-amp-classic-furnishings>LA Dreaming &&nbsp;Classic Furnishings</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quinta-Brunsons-pool.jpg> Dirt <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo! Life</a>&nbsp;explained that Quinta always dreamed of being in media and found a love for comedy at a young age. After growing up in West Philadelphia and attending college at Temple University, Brunson left the East Coast for the West to pursue her dreams. To make ends meet, the actress worked at the Apple store while trying to make it as a standup comic and working at BuzzFeed. Eventually, Brunson's success got her noticed and she moved from a Los Angeles apartment to her dreamy $1.5 million home.</p><p><a href=#>The Los Angeles-based mansion</a> has an open floor plan with all four bedrooms being on the same wing. With Brunson's family being from the East Coast, she and her husband will have plenty of room for visitors in their guest rooms. Likewise, Brunson has a walk-in closet attached to the master bedroom with a&nbsp;two-sink bathroom.&nbsp;Outside of the bedrooms, the floating fireplace in the living room is a wonderful focal point, but it's the sliding glass doors that&nbsp;lead to the cozy backyard and sundeck that make the space inviting for guests.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Leslie Jordan’s Deluxe Los Angeles Condo in the Sky Lists For $1.8 Million</a></span></p><h2 id=the-top-of-the-line-kitchen-amp-appliances>The Top-Of-The-Line Kitchen & Appliances</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Quinta-Brunson-posing-in-a-dress.jpg> Via The Hollywood Reporter<p>With an open floor plan, Brunson has the ability to entertain and cook all in the same area. The state-of-the-art kitchen has an island for people to eat and sip at, while skylights light up the home. The kitchen also has stainless steel appliances that are the perfect addition for those who enjoy cooking. Just beyond the island is space for a dining room (although the pergola outside would make for a fantastic eating area as well), which then connects to the living room. Whether a person is cooking, sitting by the fire, or heading outside, the space is open and welcoming for all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As much as Brunson loves Philadelphia and shows that passion for the city in her network television show about a <a href=#>poorly funded Philadelphia school</a>, she loves her Los Angeles pad too much to move back to the East Coast. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>, Brunson explained that she wouldn't move back to Philadelphia after all these years. The actress said, "[Philadelphia's] something uniquely bad this summer and I think it’s a convergence of issues from the pandemic, and also social media; it’s just a lot of things that came together to make this year really hard as far as guns just being out of control and everywhere.” She continued saying,&nbsp;“Even if I was in Philly, I wouldn’t be in Philly right now."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now that Brunson made her time in Los Angeles permanent with the purchase of her&nbsp;Valley Village home, there's no telling what more she's capable of in terms of comedy in the future. However, Brunson's&nbsp;stardom is only going to shine brighter, which means her earning potential could rise, and a more expensive (and larger) home could be on the horizon. While there's nothing on the horizon for Brunson outside of working on&nbsp;Abbott Elementary, fans can't wait to see what season 3 has in store.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Inside Kelly Clarkson's $5.4 Million Mega Mansion In Los Angeles</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaaZaCarqx5yKeqopyVYr62tc2tmGaaoqq7tLvNrGRqZWViuqq4y6Kmp2WmlrmtsdhmraKknJa0pnnHqKSeZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./beetlejuice-original-broadway-cast-dead-mom-lyrics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Beetlejuice Original Broadway Cast Dead Mom Lyrics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-are-fans-so-worried-for-jessica-simpson-a-look-into-the-stars-personal-life-and-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Are Fans So Worried For Jessica Simpson?
