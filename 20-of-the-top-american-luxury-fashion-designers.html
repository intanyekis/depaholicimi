American luxury designers have been somewhat under-appreciated being left in the dust of Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Hermes thanks to these designers being a type of &nbsp;status symbol attracting new money. While there is essentially no difference in quality between European or American luxury designers, American designers have a way of leaving the pretentiousness at the door. Younger consumers have shown a preference for American designers due to their willingness to experiment with bright colors and trendy designs set at a price point that won't break the bank as many European designers have outrageous price points that can seem untouchable at times. Many American luxury designers have taken their designs to the next level creating an entire empire on their vision alone.
