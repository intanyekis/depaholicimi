At one of Carlile’s shows, they finally <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a30655706/brandi-carlile-wife-catherine-shepherd/>met in person</a>.

Eventually, they found an LGBTQ+-sensitive instructor.</p><p class=dh>Through them, the couple could navigate and identify their parental inclinations together.
