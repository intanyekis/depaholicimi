His nickname, Billy Bob, follows a family tradition set by his father, William Raymond “Billy Ray” Thornton, a high school teacher and basketball coach. Raised in a Methodist household with two brothers, Thornton’s family frequently moved within Arkansas, residing in Alpine, Malvern, and Mount Holly. The family faced financial challenges, living in a shack without electricity or plumbing.</p><p>During high school, Thornton excelled in baseball and seemed destined for a professional career until an injury ended his hopes of joining the Kansas City Royals. He then worked for the Arkansas State Transportation Department and studied psychology at Henderson State University before dropping out and moving to Los Angeles.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Billy_Bob_Thornton_Career></span><strong>Billy Bob Thornton Career </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thornton moved to Los Angeles with his childhood friend, Tom Epperson, aiming to break into the entertainment industry. Although he struggled initially, working in fast-food restaurants and as a telemarketer, he began to gain traction as a musician in the band Jack Hammer. A chance encounter with director Billy Wilder shifted his focus from acting to screenwriting, setting the stage for his breakthrough.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Breakthrough></span><strong>Breakthrough </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thornton’s major breakthrough came with “One False Move,” which he co-wrote and starred in, receiving critical acclaim. However, it was “Sling Blade” that solidified his status in Hollywood. Thornton wrote, directed, and starred in the film, earning an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay and a nomination for Best Actor.</p><p>Following “Sling Blade,” Thornton appeared in films like “Primary Colors,” “Armageddon,” “A Simple Plan,” and “Monster’s Ball.” He also directed “All the Pretty Horses” in 2000, though the film’s poor reception led him to vow never to direct again.</p><p><strong>Also Read</strong>: <a href=#>Ben Roethlisberger Net Worth</a></p><p>Thornton’s filmography expanded with roles in “Bandits,” “The Man Who Wasn’t There,” and the cult classic “Bad Santa,” where he played an alcoholic, suicidal Santa Claus. He diversified his roles to avoid typecasting, appearing in films like “The Astronaut Farmer.”</p><p>In 2014, Thornton shifted focus to television, earning acclaim for his role in “Fargo.” He later starred in the Amazon series “Goliath” from 2016 to 2021, further cementing his reputation as a versatile actor.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Personal_Life></span><strong>Personal Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Billy Bob Thornton’s personal life has been marked by several high-profile relationships. He married six times, with his most notable marriage being to Angelina Jolie from 2000 to 2002. Thornton has four children from his various marriages. His current wife is Connie Angland, whom he married in 2014 after an 11-year relationship. They have one child together and reside in Los Angeles.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Real_Estate></span><strong>Real Estate </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thornton’s real estate ventures have seen mixed results. In 2000, he and Angelina Jolie purchased a Beverly Hills property from Slash for $3.7 million. Thornton retained the property after their divorce, eventually selling it for $8 million in 2013. In 2008, he bought a home in Malibu’s Point Dume for $2.35 million, selling it at a $250,000 loss in 2018. In 2013, Thornton acquired a Brentwood property for $2.7 million, featuring a solar-heated saltwater pool and extensive balconies.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Billy_Bob_Thornton_Net_Worth></span><strong>Billy Bob Thornton Net Worth </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Billy Bob Thornton net worth is $45 million.</p><b>Email your news TIPS to Editor@kahawatungu.com or WhatsApp +254707482874</b><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmijkZ2uuK3TrqWgrV6YvK57waKjpbFdl7yjedOhpqumpKS7brrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brandon-cottom-height-age-who-wife-biography-wiki-net-worth-19150-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brandon Cottom Height, Age, Who, Wife, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./16-modern-wwe-wrestlers-who-would-have-been-perfect-for-dx.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>16 Modern WWE Wrestlers Who Would Have Been Perfect For DX</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-mariah-careys-worst-outfits-that-prove-she-has-no-fashion-taste.html>15 Of Mariah Carey's Worst Outfits That Prove She Has No Fashion Taste</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heres-how-much-the-cast-members-of-euphoria-make-per-episode.html>Here's How Much The Cast Members Of Euphoria Make Per Episode</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-bonet.html>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-belzer-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Richard Belzer obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX.
