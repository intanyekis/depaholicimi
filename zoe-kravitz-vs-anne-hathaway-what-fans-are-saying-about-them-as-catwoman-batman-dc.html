Fans have had their opinions on each actress who has played the anti-heroine, but most people of this generation <a href=#>talk about Hathaway </a>and are voicing their opinions on Kravitz.</p><p>There will always be people who think someone else could do better or that something as legendary as Catwoman should be left alone. Here's what fans are saying about <a href=#>Zoe Kravtiz</a> and Anne Hathaway's roles as Catwoman.</p><h2 id=anne-hathaway-39-s-time-as-catwoman><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Anne Hathaway's Time As Catwoman</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anne Hathaway played Catwoman in the 2012 film, The Dark Knight Rises, directed by Christopher Nolan. She is the last actress to play a live-action Catwoman in a Batman movie. Technically, in her version, Hathaway plays Selina Kyle and is never referred to as Catwoman. Her version was a skilled thief that hopes to commit a crime that would give her a normal life. Despite the movie not receiving good reviews, Hathaway did and some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">critics even called her "the best catwoman ever."</a></p><h2 id=zoe-kravitz-posted-a-photo-of-her-as-catwoman><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Zoe Kravitz Posted A Photo Of Her As Catwoman</span></h2><p>Zoe Kravitz deleted all of her posts on Instagram and returned to the social media app by posting the first look of her as Selina Kyle. She sports shoulder-length hair and a white tank top to portray her non-superhero persona. However, last year she was seen on set wearing a black leather coat with a belt, fishnets, a hat and knee-high boots. Fans seem to be pretty happy about her Catwoman outfit, complete with claws and leather.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-the-batman-39-film><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>'The Batman' Film</span></h2><p>The Batman is expected to be released in March 2022. It was originally set to be released in June 2021, but due to production delays because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was delayed. The movie stars Robert Pattinson as the titular character, along with Kravitz, Paul Dano, Jeffrey Wright, John Turturro, Peter Sarsgaard, Andy Serkis and Colin Farrell. The film takes place in Batman's sophomore year of fighting crime, he faces corruption in Gotham City as he fights <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Riddler.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Little Known Facts About The New Catwoman: Zoe Kravitz</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kravitz-was-39-truly-born-for-the-role-39><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Kravitz Was 'Truly Born For The Role'</span></h2><p>Most Batman fans seem to be pretty satisfied with Kravitz playing the role of Catwoman, @GoblinGambino tweeted a photo of Lego Catwoman and Kravitz and captioned it, "Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman. She was truly born for the role *insert cat emoji*." Kravitz also played Catwoman in The Lego Batman, making her the first woman to voice the character and play her in a live-action movie. Fans think she is a great pick because Catwoman was depicted as African American originally.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Facts About Zoe Kravitz That Lisa Bonet And Jason Momoa Want To Keep On The DL</a></span></p><h2 id=hathaway-39-s-character-39-was-dope-39><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Hathaway's Character 'Was Dope'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a discussion with other Twitter users, @chasethemoney2x expressed their opinion on Hathaway's time as the character. "Anna hathaway caracter was dope, but it wasn’t all that. Th reason why ppl liked her is because we had a feeling that she was still supposed to become the catwomen. In darknight she didn’t had any claws or whips. Let alone someone calling her Catwoman…" They were not a fan of Hathaway but liked how her character was depicted. There was so much potential, but she didn't get to become Catwoman.</p><h2 id=she-has-to-be-the-most-boring-catwoman><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Has To Be The Most Boring Catwoman</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another Batman fan reiterated the previous person comments saying, "anne hathaway's catwoman gotta be the most boring catwoman tho ngl." Hathaway would have been interested in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reprising her role</a> if the right people were involved, meaning director Christopher Nolan, she told Comic Book, but with the movie being rebooted many times, she might not get her opportunity. Fans think her character might have been boring, because she didn't get to dig fully into Catwoman and spent a lot of her time as Kyle.</p><h2 id=solo-39-catwoman-39-movie-with-kravitz><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Solo 'Catwoman' Movie With Kravitz</span></h2><p>The movie hasn't even come out yet, and fans are already loving Kravitz as the character so much so that they want a solo Catwoman movie with the 32-year-old in it. "Batman is holding Catwoman back, live action wise. With the amount of stories written of her solo and doing things not involving Bruce she could hold down 5 movies and/or a TV Spinoff. @ZoeKravitz I hope your agent got you those deals cause I faith in you," tweeted @OddPercentage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Anne Hathaway & 9 Other Celebrities Who Were Emotionally Affected By Their Roles</a></span></p><h2 id=39-i-really-like-anne-hathaway-but-not-as-catwoman-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>'I Really Like Anne Hathaway, But Not As Catwoman'</span></h2><p>"I really like Anne Hathaway, but her Catwoman wasn’t iconic or even memorable at this point," @marccs tweeted. Hathaway has had many roles that defined her career including The Princess Diaries and its sequel, The Devil Wears Prada, Valentine's Day, Alice Through The Looking Glass and more, but for some reason her time in The Dark Knight Rises was not perceived well. People like her as a person and an actress but didn't think that role was made for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-makes-me-39-want-to-hyperventilate-39><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She Makes Me 'Want To Hyperventilate'</span></h2><p>@JupiterJazz1369 is super excited to see Kravitz take on this role, so much show that they are hyperventilating and going to the bathroom in their pants. She is many people's dream casting for this role, and it will be exciting to see how she portrays the character. There is already hype around it and the more that is released about the movie, gets fans even more excited. She may be the scene-stealer in the movie, as she is the only lead female in the film.</p><h2 id=kravitz-should-be-in-the-purple-outfit><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kravitz Should Be In The Purple Outfit</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Kravitz voice Catwoman in The Lego Batman and wore a purple suit, fans want her suit to be purple in the live-action version as well. Catwoman <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">also wore purple in some of the comics</a> in the 1990s. Sadly, the promo videos and pictures have Kravitz in the classic black leather suit, but maybe in a solo movie or another time, she could rock the purple.
