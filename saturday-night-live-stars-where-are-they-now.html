In fact, the NBC sketch comedy series has become a launching pad for hit talk shows, films, sitcoms and game shows since its 1975 premiere.</p><p>Murphy, for his part, appeared as a cast member from 1980 to 1984. He went on to become a lucrative movie star, but tension between him and the show arose after <a href=#><strong>David Spade</strong></a> joked about the Coming to America actor’s career in a 1995 sketch. “Look, children, it’s a falling star!” the Joe Dirt actor quipped following the releases of Murphy’s films Vampire in Brooklyn and Harlem Nights, which failed to win over the box office.</p><p>“What really irritated me about it at the time was that it was a career shot. It was like, ‘Hey, come on, man, it’s one thing for you guys to do a joke about some movie of mine, but my career?’” Murphy told Rolling Stone in 2011. “I’m one of you guys.”</p><p>The Nutty Professor star <a href=#>briefly returned to Saturday Night Live</a> in 2015 for the show’s 40th anniversary special. However, he did not take the Studio 8H stage by force again until December 2019, when he <a href=#>hosted an episode</a> that earned him his first Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.</p><p>“You don’t want to wait 30 years to come back and the show ain’t s—t,” Murphy told the <a href=#>Today show</a> ahead of his hosting gig. “It be like people clapping, going, ‘I thought he was going to be so much funnier than this.’”</p><p>The comedian’s return came amid a high point in his film career. “The timing couldn’t be better,” he said. “That’s why I feel like [I’m in] a dream.”</p><p>Murphy is not the only former cast member to make a major comeback on the long-running series. <a href=#><strong>Maya Rudolph</strong></a> ended her tenure in 2007 but <a href=#>returned</a> in 2019 to portray Vice President <a href=#><strong>Kamala Harris</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m so grateful always to be a part of that place, and then, when in my wildest dreams did I think there would ever be a candidate that looks remotely close to whatever this is?” Rudolph explained during an October 2020 appearance on <a href=#>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a>. “I realize I started working there 21 years ago. How am I still standing? … I love it.”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to see where former Saturday Night Live stars are now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BorrXB0Z2YsmWenrSpwIyloK%2BdXajBor7SZq6hnaKaeqK%2BxGaroZ2pYruww44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mayyas-golden-buzzer-agt-season-17-episode-4-recap.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Season 17 Episode 4 Recap Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mike-tirico-net-worth-biography-wiki-age-parents-family-photos-or-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mike Tirico net worth, Biography, Wiki, Age, Parents, Family, photos or more</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-mariah-careys-worst-outfits-that-prove-she-has-no-fashion-taste.html>15 Of Mariah Carey's Worst Outfits That Prove She Has No Fashion Taste</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heres-how-much-the-cast-members-of-euphoria-make-per-episode.html>Here's How Much The Cast Members Of Euphoria Make Per Episode</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-bonet.html>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-belzer-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Richard Belzer obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX.
