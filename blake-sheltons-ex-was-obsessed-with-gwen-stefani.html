She added that she was a big fan of the British band Madness, and said that she cried when the group’s singer, Suggs, got married. She also revealed that she wasn’t the only one with an obsession: It turns out that Shelton, 41, once dated a girl who was in love with “The Sweet Escape” singer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/149201_5854_gwen-stefani-jimmy-kimmel-zoom.jpg><p>“He did tell me that he dated a girl for, like, three months that had my face plastered over her whole bedroom,” she dished. “So that’s kind of weird, right?”</p><p>“That’s really weird,” Kimmel, 50, said. Then he gave the singer an idea for a prank. “You know what you oughta do? I hope Blake isn’t watching so you can surprise him.

I thought you were like a rock/ska girl.’ He didn’t even know what ska is!”</p><p>She added: “I did make him a ska-like reggae playlist for Valentine’s a couple years ago. He doesn’t really listen to it that often.”</p><p>The Voice coaches, who began dating in November 2015, often gush about one another and recently revealed that they’ve both thought<a href=#> about marriage</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabpJGgsm6%2Fx56jraeeqHqmxIywmKxln5fApr%2FSnptmr5mptW6z1p6lZqukmrOiusho</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./charles-butt-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Charles Butt Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./a-glance-at-the-exponential-rise-of-david-fosters-career-and-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>A Glance At The Exponential Rise Of David Foster's Career And Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-mariah-careys-worst-outfits-that-prove-she-has-no-fashion-taste.html>15 Of Mariah Carey's Worst Outfits That Prove She Has No Fashion Taste</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heres-how-much-the-cast-members-of-euphoria-make-per-episode.html>Here's How Much The Cast Members Of Euphoria Make Per Episode</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-bonet.html>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-belzer-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Richard Belzer obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX.
