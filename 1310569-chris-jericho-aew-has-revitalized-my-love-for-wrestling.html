Jericho said he’s just getting started there and feels he’s doing some of the best work of his career.</p><p>“We’re just getting started, that’s the thing. That’s one of the things I love about AEW is it’s really revitalized my love for wrestling, my creativity,” Chris Jericho said. “I think the last three years have been some of the best work of my career. It’s exciting for me when each week you’re seeing the audience expand, you see more people hearing about AEW, and this is my company. We helped create this company, Tony and I and Kenny and Nick and Matt and Cody. And to see how big we’ve gotten in such a short time, it really means a lot to me because I could have stayed in WWE. It would have been great, but I wanted to really try and see if we could change the course of wrestling history, and I think we’ve done that already.</p><p>“Once again, just getting started. There’s so many places we haven’t even been to yet, even in America. Worldwide, we haven’t even had one international show yet. I think the first time we go to London, we can draw 50,000 people there. So yeah, it’s really exciting to be here and just to be doing what I consider some of my best work ever.”</p><p>When asked about the creative freedom he has in All Elite Wrestling compared to what he’s done in the past, Jericho revealed he’s had a big hand in helping write every story he’s had in the company so far.</p><p>“I always had a degree of creative freedom in the past, but now it’s a lot of responsibility,” Chris Jericho said. “Because if you look at, since day one, we had the Inner Circle. There’s five guys that I gotta think of stuff for, and we legit do not have writers. That’s not some kind of a gimmick or some kind of story. There’s nobody writing. It’s Tony’s writing and some of the guys that have kind of earned that space of writing. But I write every single story that I’ve seen so far, with Tony’s input, and you know, when I did a year with MJF, he was very involved. I just did eight months with Eddie Kingston. Eddie had ideas, but it was just ideas that I had.</p><p>“Once again, let the story lead you. If you let the story lead you, it always works out better than if you’re trying to lead the story because then you almost have to shoehorn things, and it never works. So it’s been very organic, these storylines that we’ve been doing, and it’s great to have the creative freedom. But like I said, it’s a lot of pressure. Now I’m in the Jericho Appreciation Society; there’s eight, so I can’t write for everybody, but I try to give ideas and thoughts, keep the plates spinning for everybody as well. But that’s part of my job. It’s one of the reasons why I’m here is I think the type of experience lends to the creativity which lends to the stories that we’re telling.”</p><p>&nbsp;<a href=#>Chris Jericho: Social Media’s Influence Is Overrated, You Gotta Take It With A Grain Of Salt</a></p><p>What do you make of Chris Jericho’s comments?
