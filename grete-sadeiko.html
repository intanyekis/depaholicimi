A heptathlete, Sadieko is originally from Estonia who competed collegiately at Florida State University. While the duo makes an unlikely pair and fans often wonder as to how and where they met, they enjoy each other’s company and got married two years after they first met. While Griffin III is well known in the sports fold for his plays in the NFL, Sadeiko doesn’t fall too far behind in terms of fame. She comes from a family of heptathletes and excels at the sport. Last we heard, Sadeiko was busy training for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, which has now been moved to 2021.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life:</h2><p>Grete Šadeiko was born on the 29th of May, 1993, in Turi Estonia. Born to&nbsp; David Šadeiko and Gritas Šadeiko, Sadieko comes from a family of athletes and has an older sister, Grit Šadeiko, and a younger sister, Jade Šadeiko. While both Grete and Grit were into track and field, the youngest Jade was into volleyball. As a young kid, Grete matriculated from Turi Uhisgumnaasium High School in Estonia before moving to the United States to join Florida University. She enrolled at the university to study psychology and graduated in 2016.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Grete-Sadeiko-.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Playing career:</h2><p>A heptathlete through and through, Greta gradually rose through the ranks and was part of several folds as an athlete. Her first major tournament was the 2010 World Junior Championships which was held in Moncton, Canada. She ranked fourth in the Heptathlon event with a total of 5705 pts. In 2012, Greta returned to the big stage and competed in the World Junior Championships for the 2nd time in a row. The competition was held in Barcelona, Spain, and Greta only managed to secure 9th position with a total of 5517 pts. Great’s greatest performance to date came in the European U23 Championships, where she managed to secure a total of 5813 pts. But despite her impressive points tally, Greta only managed to secure 5th position in the competition.&nbsp;</p><p>After 2014, Great took a break from the sport to sort out her family life with Robert Griffin III. But following the birth of her child, Greta is very much back in the fold and is now looking to showcase her skills at her very first Olympic event.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personal Life:</h2><p>Greta Sadeiko is happily married to her husband, Robert Griffin III. The pair first met in 2016, following Griffin’s divorce from his long-time girlfriend,&nbsp; Rebecca Liddicoat. The pair moved through the gears pretty quickly and became engaged on the 13th of May 2017. The pair’s first daughter Gloria Griffin was born on the 2nd of July 2017. The couple made things official in a lavish wedding on the 10th of March 2018 and went on to have a second child Gameya Griffin in September of 2019. Following the birth of their daughter, Grete <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">took </a>to Instagram to express her joy and love for her husband.</p><p>“Our little angel was born. Couldn’t have done it without this man by my side, my backbone. Trying to make me laugh every way possible and keeping me entertained through all the pain and doing everything to make me smile and get through this. You deserve a medal baby! Welcome to the world, Gloria Griffin! You are SOOOOO loved by daddy and me!”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wiki-Bio Facts:</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=3.9274193548387><tr><td><strong>Birth Name:</strong></td><td>Grete Šadeiko</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of Birth:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td><td>May 29, 1993</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality:&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Estonian</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth-place:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Türi, Estonia</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Parents:</strong></td><td>David Šadeiko , Gritas Šadeiko</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Heptathlete</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Marital Status:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Colour:&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Blonde</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Colour: &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Estonian</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Grete Sadeiko Height:</strong></td><td>5 feet 9 inches (178 centimeters)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Children:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Gloria Griffin, Gameya Griffin</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Grete Sadeiko Net Worth:</strong></td><td>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Husband:</strong></td><td>Robert Griffin III</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sibling:</strong></td><td>Grit Sadeiko</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Social Media Handle:</strong></td><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qippake6S7zGieq52kmnq0rcOeoKSnXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./california-man-coughs-blood-clot-shape-lung.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>California man coughs up blood clot in shape of lung</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./raymond-griner-brittney-griner-father.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Raymond Griner?
