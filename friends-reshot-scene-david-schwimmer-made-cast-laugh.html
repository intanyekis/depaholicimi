Others pointed out it was "so fun to see David losing it," because Ross never laughs that way.</p><p>Fans also guessed that Lisa added the screeching that was Phoebe 'singing along,' because Jennifer Aniston seemed as if she had not expected that at all. Whatever the script said, Lisa telling Matthew to "do it again" as he screeched, making David laugh even more, probably wasn't in it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/did-matt-leblanc-ever-feud-with-david-schwimmer-and-matthew-perry-during-their-time-on-friends_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Matt LeBlanc Ever Feud With David Schwimmer And Matthew Perry During Their Time On Friends?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer portrayed best friends but they may not have gotten along all the time behind the scenes.</span><p>Long after the episode aired, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Kudrow named "The One With Joey's New Brain" as her favorite episode</a>, solely due to the bagpipes scene. Calling the episode "so stupid and funny," Kudrow even laughed while recalling the memory.</p><p>While <a href=#>some Friends episodes were written based on the cast's experiences</a>, Ross' lack of musicality was a seemingly random plot point, but he didn't only play the bagpipes.</p><h2 id=other-episodes-also-featured-hilarity-with-ross-39-quot-music-quot>Other Episodes Also Featured Hilarity With Ross' "Music"</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/david-schwimmer-as-ross-playing-keyboard-on-friends.jpg><p>Though Ross' bagpipes performance was cringe yet hilarious, there were other episodes that kept up the theme of "Ross is smart but musically untalented," bringing even more laughs to the cast and, of course, audiences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In "The One Where Chandler Crosses the Line," Ross takes up another musical instrument</a>, playing the keyboard very badly. The four seven, episode 15 scene precedes the bagpipes performance and starts with Ross giving Phoebe some guitar advice, which she happily accepts.</p><p>Then, Monica recalls their high school years, when Ross would play the keyboard in the basement, not letting anyone hear his "sound." Apparently, there was a very good reason no one heard Ross play: he's patently terrible.</p><p>After Ross brings his keyboard out of storage and has a few false starts where he's explaining his "work" to everyone (minus Joey), he begins to play. His keyboard playing features a backing rhythm and random noises that Ross hits with various expressions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/9BA64EE2-EEA8-4AF3-ABBC-6B09E64A96E3.jpeg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Lisa Kudrow Had This Very Bad Habit Behind The Scenes On Friends</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Lisa Kudrow might not remember her time on Friends very well, but her co-stars (and the audience) remember the many outtakes of Phoebe Buffay.</span><p>Fortunately for the cast in this scene, cracking a smile was completely fine as part of the script. Jennifer Aniston covered her smile with her hand, while <a href=#><strong>Courteney Cox</strong></a> and Matthew Perry looked uncomfortableâ€”appropriately for the scene.</p><p>When Ross leaves the room to 'grab his helicopter sounds,' Monica reflects, "God bless my dad for soundproofing the basement." Rachel says, "Oh I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers."</p><p>Lisa Kudrow doesn't crack a smile, but that's for a reason; Phoebe is meant to be supportive of Ross' "art," with her line being "What are you guys talking about? I loved it. It was so moving."</p><p>The scene appeared to have gone off without a hitch, but it's unlikely that was the very first take, given David Schwimmer's other musical performances on Friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other hilarious moments, like the <a href=#>blooper that preceded the iconic "Pivot" scene</a>, never made it onto the show, but thankfully, leaks to YouTube have made it possible for fans to revisit their favorite moments outside of what actually aired.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidq6GVo7G0edGeqqGnpGLApLHNnmSdmaaesW6%2FwqGuoqWdmr9uucCdnGabkajBbrjArp6hZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hayden-fire-expands-to-over-14000-acres-amidst-critical-weather-conditions.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hayden fire expands to over 14,000 acres amidst critical weather conditions</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./karen-pittman.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Karen Pittman net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-mariah-careys-worst-outfits-that-prove-she-has-no-fashion-taste.html>15 Of Mariah Carey's Worst Outfits That Prove She Has No Fashion Taste</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heres-how-much-the-cast-members-of-euphoria-make-per-episode.html>Here's How Much The Cast Members Of Euphoria Make Per Episode</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-bonet.html>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-belzer-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Richard Belzer obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX.
