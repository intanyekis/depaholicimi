While Euphoria may be one of the most popular drama on T.V. now, not all of its cast are paid equally. As with most television shows, an actor’s salary is dependent on their previous work, popularity, and the size of their role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Euphoria’s showrunner <a href=#>Zendaya is reportedly making seven figures per episode</a>, many of her co-stars aren’t even making a million dollars per season. While the official salaries of the Euphoria cast remain unconfirmed, here’s everything we know about their pay.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Lamar Odom Launches A Company To Provide Seniors With Affordable Housing</a></span></p><h2 id=angus-cloud>Angus Cloud</h2><p>Angus Cloud’s portrayal of Fezco on Euphoria has resonated with fans, and he had a bigger role in the second season, which likely means a pay increase, as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Generally, lead actors on HBO shows can make anywhere between $150,000 to $1 million per episode, while <a href=#>supporting actors average somewhere around $50,000</a> to $150,000. It’s possible Angus makes six figures for a full season, but it’s unlikely he’s getting paid that much per episode. Overall, he has a net worth of $3 million.</p><h2 id=maude-apatow>Maude Apatow</h2><p>Maude Apatow plays Lexi Howard in Euphoria, and likely earns a supporting actor’s wage between $50,000 to $150,000 per episode. The nepo baby has a <a href=#>reported net worth of $2 million</a>.</p><h2 id=alexa-demie>Alexa Demie</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though she’s considered a newcomer to Hollywood, Alexa Demie has made waves thanks to her portrayal of Euphoria’s Maddy Perez. With a net worth of $2 million, the actress has a <a href=#>reported annual salary of $230,000</a>, which is a reasonable guess as to how much she makes per season on the show.</p><h2 id=barbie-ferreira>Barbie Ferreira</h2><p>Barbie Ferreira made Kat Hernandez a beloved character during Euphoria’s first two seasons, but many fans noticed she had a smaller role in the second one, which may have meant a reduction in her salary, too.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href=#>Barbie revealed she won’t be returning to the hit show</a> and is rather focusing on other projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hunter-schafer>Hunter Schafer</h2><p>She may be considered a supporting character, but Hunter Schafer gets a lot more screentime than other characters, largely thanks to her character Jules’ friendship with Rue. <a href=#>With a net worth of $4 million,</a> Hunter easily makes six figures for every season.</p><h2 id=jacob-elordi>Jacob Elordi</h2><p>Jacob Elordi has a more extensive acting portfolio than many of his co-stars (including a role in Netflix’s hit film The Kissing Booth), so he may get a higher pay than some of the other support actors. <a href=#>He’s reportedly worth $4 million in total</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sydney-sweeney>Sydney Sweeney</h2><p>Sydney Sweeney has received critical acclaim for portraying the emotional Cassie Howard in Euphoria. Estimates suggest the actress e<a href=#>arned around $350,000 for appearing in 13 episodes</a>.</p><p>Aside from Euphoria, Sydney is known for roles in shows like Handmaid’s Tale and White Lotus. She’s also starred in a variety of campaigns recently, including for brands like Ford, Le Neige, and Miu Miu.</p><p>Last year, Sydney experience backlash when she said she can’t take a break from working, otherwise she’d be unable to afford her lifestyle.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Selena Gomez Is Almost Worth $1 Billion As She Celebrates 31st Birthday</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"If I wanted to take a six-month break, I don't have income to cover that," <a href=#>she told The Hollywood Reporter in July 2022</a>. "I don't have someone supporting me, I don't have anyone I can turn to, to pay my bills or call for help."</p><p>"The established stars still get paid, but I have to give 5 percent to my lawyer, 10 percent to my agents, 3 percent or something like that to my business manager," Sydney continued. "I have to pay my publicist every month, and that's more than my mortgage."</p><p>"They don't pay actors like they used to, and with streamers, you no longer get residuals,” she added.</p><h2 id=zendaya>Zendaya</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zendaya is unsurprisingly the most well-paid actor on Euphoria. She’s only 26-years old, but Zendaya already had an impressive acting resume when she started with the show in 2019, which explains her high salary.</p><p>But Zendaya wasn’t always making so much on Euphoria. In fact, the actress only renegotiated her salary recently in February. She’ll now be making <a href=#>approximately $1 million per episode</a>, making her one of the best paid stars on television. It’s also been reported she’s the youngest T.V. actress to get such a high pay.</p><p>Euphoria typically has 8 episodes per season, so Zendaya will likely make around $8 million for season three, which is <a href=#>expected to debut sometime in early 2024.</a></p><p>“My greatest wish for Euphoria was that it could help heal people,” <a href=#>Zendaya said in 2022 while accepting an Emmy</a> for her portrayal of Rue in the hit HBO show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I just want to say thank you to everyone who has shared their story with me,” she continued. “I want you to know that anyone who has loved a Rue or feels like they are a Rue, I want you to know I’m so grateful for your stories, and I carry them with me, and I carry them with her.”</p><p>Clearly, Zendaya loves working on Euphoria, and the fans love seeing her in it. And with such a high salary, it’s safe to assume Zendaya will stay with the show for as long as possible.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>How Joe Manganiello & Sofia Vergara’s $100 Million Prenup Affects Their Divorce</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, <a href=#>LA Times</a>, <a href=#>Yahoo</a>, <a href=#>Quora</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1pr7ErGShp6diuravx2aroZ1dmK60wIymnKaalafAbrvFZpyuqJikv6qtjKaYpJ1dpbKzecSpoKynlJp8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lisa-bonet.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./babyname.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-mariah-careys-worst-outfits-that-prove-she-has-no-fashion-taste.html>15 Of Mariah Carey's Worst Outfits That Prove She Has No Fashion Taste</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./babyname.html>Connor - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./heres-how-much-the-cast-members-of-euphoria-make-per-episode.html>Here's How Much The Cast Members Of Euphoria Make Per Episode</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-bonet.html>Lisa Bonet Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richard-belzer-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death.html>Richard Belzer obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX.
