When you look at her, you can’t believe that the star is 40 years old. You might be wondering that how she manages to look so young and fit. If so, here are the answers you are looking for.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Melissa-Joan-Hart-poses-backstage-at-the-Kids-Rock-fashion-show-during-Spring-2016-New-York-Fashion-Week.jpg><h3><strong>Best Health Secrets</strong></h3><p>The actress believes there are 3 best ways to stay fit. First is to drink ample amount of&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>water</a>, second is to exercise on a daily basis and third is to take care of your diet. She revealed these secrets to <a href=# rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>US Weekly</a> recently.</p><h3><strong>Workout Secrets</strong></h3><p>The mother of three doesn’t always have the time to hit the gym. Rather than admitting that she can’t do it and letting go of exercising, she adds fitness into her daily routine. She does almost all the little things around the house to stay active all day. Melissa&nbsp;even calls her kids her dumbbells as she often has to lift them.</p><p>She even confessed that she does <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>squats</a> by using Tucker’s (her son) assistance. She calls them baby squats as she lifts him and goes up and down with him in her arms. If you don’t have kids, you can use a medicine ball or even a laundry basket for these easy squats. She also does calf raises when she is cooking or waiting in any line such as a bank’s line. She also uses home furniture like stools, chairs or even steps to do triceps when she has a few minutes to spare.</p><h3><strong>Gym Bag</strong></h3><p>One of the key things that can motivate you to stay fit is to keep your gym bag ready so that even if you get a few minutes time, you are up for hitting the gym. Hart fills her gym bag with things like water, protein bars for post-workout snacking, some extra clothes, extra socks, deodorant, etc. She keeps it away from the reach of her kids and near to the door so that she can access it quickly whenever she needs it.</p><h3><strong>Diet Secrets</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Melissa-Joan-Hart-and-Mark-Wilkerson.jpg><p>The wife of Mark Wilkerson believes that diet is equally important for fitness. She thinks that it’s almost impossible for anyone to out-train bad nutrition. So, you’ll be smart not to let go of your good diet habits and stick to the healthy diet habits.</p><h3><strong>Food Swapping</strong></h3><p>The director has developed some good food swapping habits too. She snacks on kale chips and has swapped pasta for zucchini noodles. She makes these dishes&nbsp;herself at home.</p><h3><strong>Stay Hydrated</strong></h3><p>The God’s Not Dead 2 (2016) actress likes to keep herself hydrated by sipping fruit flavored water the entire day. She admits that staying hydrated is super important for everyone but it’s not easy to keep drinking water all day long as she often forgets to drink it. She keeps a bottle filled with flavored water with her. Melissa&nbsp;makes this flavored water by adding lemon (or lime), cucumber or orange in water.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Melissa-Joan-Hart-in-workout-gear.jpg><h3><strong>Working Out With Hubby</strong></h3><p>The Rose DeMarco (2014) actress has now started working out with her husband who is a former singer and guitarist for rock band Course of Nature. He trains her and her friends at home and it’s a lot of fun for all. The major benefit of working out with him is that they keep at it for hours at times. He also motivates the diva to keep up with the workout routines and live a healthy lifestyle.</p><h3><strong>Sticking to the Good Habits</strong></h3><p>The Teenage Witch (1996–2003) actress lost 40 pounds with <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Nutrisystem</a> in 2014 and it seems that she is still reaping the benefits of good habits she learned from the weight loss journey.</p><h3><strong>The Awesomeness</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Melissa-Joan-Hart-red-swimsuit.jpg><p>The stunner feels amazing by realizing the fact that she can wear a swimsuit without any problems now. She recently sported her swimsuit look and dazzled all. Melissa&nbsp;said that the red suit she donned was one of her favorites as it’s playful, sexy and a bit reserved at the same time.</p><h3><strong>No Deprivation</strong></h3><p>The businesswoman does not believe that one should ever deprive himself or herself. She thinks that if you want to have a slice of cake or pizza every now and then, you should have it. Be sure to get back on the track the next day and stick to it for a little while.</p><p>Want to know more about Melissa’s workout routine and diet plan?
