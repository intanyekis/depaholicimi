I’m tired of the PAIN. My heart has been aching and longing to be loved by you, MY FATHER for way too long. So since you are unreachable perhaps this will get your attention.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>He continued: “I haven’t had a full conversation with you or seen you in over 15 years! You haven’t once tried to reach out to me to see how I’m feeling or how I’m doing. I have messages that literally show me reaching out to you and receiving no response for over a DECADE!</p><p>“The legend that you all love, Ghostface Killah is the full definition of a deadbeat. Dad, you let us live without light, gas or even communication from you for years. You have all this coin and yet you allow my uncles to clean up your mess.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/01/ghostface-killah-new-album-stem-player-250x142.jpg alt="Ghostface Killah To Release New Album Through Stem Player" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Ghostface Killah To Release New Album Through Stem Player</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>January 9, 2023</p></a><p>Infinite went on to claim that he lived in a homeless shelter for almost a year during the COVID-19 pandemic with no support from his father, who has also neglected his other children, including his “mentally ill” daughter, and grandchildren.</p><p>He also clarified that he isn’t looking for money, but simply Ghostface’s “heart,” “attention” and “love.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I can’t even say you’re only a deadbeat dad to me because I’m gay, because you’re a deadbeat to all of your kids,” he added. “What I’ve been seeking is the answer as to why? Is it because your father turned [his] back on you? WHYYYY do you LOVE everyone but your kids? It’s backwards, it’s ugly, it’s hurtful and it’s HUMILIATING.”</p><p>Infinite also shared alleged text messages with the Ironman rapper, in which he pleads for him to “check in” on his children more often. After seemingly ignoring several messages, Ghostface eventually replied to Infinite wishing him a happy Father’s Day, writing in part: “Thank you .. I Love you too!!! Be safe wherever you are!!!”</p><p>This isn’t the first time Infinite Coles — an established artist in his own right — has spoken about what it was like growing up as Ghostface Killah’s kin, telling NME in 2021 that the Wu-Tang legend is “a part” of him.</p><p>“I try my hardest to keep this life and that life separate,” he said. “I feel like I’m talented enough for people to just love me for me and what I can bring to the table without being attached to him. But I never mind the questions about him because, clearly, he is a part of me. So I sometimes expect that question to come up at least one time in the interview.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Infinite dropped off his&nbsp;Destiny EP in 2021, which featured appearances from Wiki and Coby Say.</p><p>As for Ghostface, he’ll soon appear&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=#>Large Professor</a>‘s upcoming album&nbsp;Down South Up Top and hit the road with <a href=# rel=noopener>Nas</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>De La Soul</a> and the rest of the Wu for the <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>second leg of the N.Y.
