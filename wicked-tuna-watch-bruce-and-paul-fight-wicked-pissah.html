The captain and the first mate are getting at each other’s throats, as they are faced with disappointment in their fishing season. With only six weeks left to finish on top, can they beat the fleet?</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>To see how high the tension rises on the high seas,&nbsp;check out the drama-heavy clip (above), exclusively debuted by&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong>.</p><h3>Paul Hebert Gives HollywoodLife.com The Fishy Scoop</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>Captain Paul caught up with&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong>, and tells us that although the season has brought on a challenge, he’s not giving up. Keep reading for Paul’s EXCLUSIVE interview!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLife.com:&nbsp;How much more intense is the pressure, now that you’re in last place this season?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-7><b>Paul:</b> “It’s very intense because there’s pressure from every angle. Toward the end of the season the pressure always gets worse because you only have so long to make money before the fishery closes but the bills still keep piling up. You’re in a race against time. But the key thing is you can’t give up, that’s one of the biggest keys to fishing. It’s not over til it’s over.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>Have you found that you and Bruce are fighting more, since the stakes are high with the rankings of the boat?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“When you’re not catching fish, you’re not making money and the stress level goes up. When you really need the money, that’s when you lose fish because you start to overthink things. Bruce and I are both under intense pressure to deliver — he has his daughter’s wedding to pay for, and I’m trying to make sure I make enough money to get my little girl through the winter. And when you’ve got a $10,000 paycheck on the line, it’s hard to put those things out of your mind.”&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>Will you two continue to fight throughout the rest of the season?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“Bruce and I have been fishing together for 30 years, and just like any boat, when you’re not catching fish, things are going to get heated. You’ve got to have a good attitude and just hang in there. Neither one of us can afford to give up, and it’s important that we work together. You can’t be successful at&nbsp;<span class=il>tuna</span>&nbsp;fishing unless you have teamwork.”&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-12><strong>What tricks to you have up your sleeve to get back on top?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“I will never give up, and I always stay positive. The glass is always half full, no matter what happens. I’m just going to keep fishing as hard as I can, because you never know. Your luck can turn around in a heartbeat. All it takes is one fish to put you back on track.”&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>Who do you think is going to win the season?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“Dave Carraro (Captain of the&nbsp;FV-<span class=il>Tuna</span>.com) is doing well right now. He’s ahead of everyone, but you never know. I have a feeling first place is out of my reach right now, but I’ve got my eyes set on second place — it’s right in my sights. My main objective is to make sure my daughter can have food on the table and warm clothes this winter. If I can accomplish that, everything will be just fine!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you watch&nbsp;Wicked Tuna?
